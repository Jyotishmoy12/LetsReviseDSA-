Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer n. A number is called good if:

It has an even number in even-indexed positions (0-based index).
It has a prime number in odd-indexed positions.
Your task is to find how many such good numbers of length n can be formed. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 
1
0
9
+
7
10 
9
 +7.

Intuition
This is a problem of combinatorics and modular arithmetic. Each digit position has specific valid choices:

Even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...): Digits can only be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Hence, there are 5 choices.
Odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...): Digits can only be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Hence, there are 4 choices.
If we know how many even and odd positions there are in the number of length n, we can compute the total combinations using exponentiation.

Approach
Understand the number of positions:

If 
𝑛
n is even, half the positions are even and half are odd.
If 
𝑛
n is odd, one more position is even than odd.
Valid choices:

Even-indexed positions: 5 choices.
Odd-indexed positions: 4 choices.

long long modExp(long long base, long long exp, long long mod) {
    long long result = 1; // Start with result = 1
    while (exp > 0) {     // Repeat until the exponent becomes 0
        if (exp % 2 == 1) { // If exp is odd
            result = (result * base) % mod; // Multiply current base to the result
        }
        base = (base * base) % mod; // Square the base
        exp /= 2; // Divide the exponent by 2
    }
    return result;
}
Step-by-Step Explanation
Initialization:

Start with result = 1. This will hold the final answer.
Loop continues until exp becomes 0.
Odd Exponent Check:

If 
exp
%
2
=
=
1
exp%2==1, it means the current exponent is odd. In that case, we multiply the current base to result.
Base Squaring:

Regardless of whether the exponent is odd or even, we always square the base.
Why? Squaring lets us efficiently "jump" through powers. For example:
2
8
=
(
2
4
)
2
2 
8
 =(2 
4
 ) 
2
 , so we only need to compute 
2
4
2 
4
  first, then square it.
Exponent Halving:

Divide the exponent by 2 to move to the next "level" of powers.

Key Intuition Behind Modular Exponentiation
Exponentiation by Squaring:

Instead of calculating

base

…
base×base×… repeatedly, squaring lets us compute powers much faster. For example:
To calculate 
2
8

)
→
(
2

)
→
(
2
8
)
2 
1
 →(2 
2
 )→(2 
4
 )→(2 
8
 ).
Modular Arithmetic:

To keep the numbers manageable, we take the modulo at every step. This prevents overflow and ensures correctness.
Why This Works for Counting Good Numbers
The same logic applies to the Count Good Numbers problem:

Compute 
5
even_positions
5 
even_positions
  and

odd_positions
  efficiently using modular exponentiation.

The basic exponentiation function calculates 
𝑎
𝑏
a 
b
 , where 
𝑎
a is the base and 
𝑏
b is the exponent, using repeated multiplication. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the expo function without modular arithmetic.

Steps to Calculate 
𝑎
𝑏
a 
b
  Using the Expo Function
We aim to compute 
𝑎
𝑏
a 
b
 , which means multiplying the base 
𝑎
a with itself 
𝑏
b times.

Recursive Implementation
Base Case:

If 
𝑏
=
0
b=0, return 1.
Why? Any number raised to the power 0 is 1 (
𝑎
0
=
1
a 
0
 =1).
Recursive Case:

If 
𝑏
>
0
b>0:
Divide the problem into two smaller parts:
Compute 
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
a 
b/2
  (i.e., calculate the result for half the exponent).
Use the result of 
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
a 
b/2
  to construct the final result:
If 
𝑏
b is even, 
𝑎
𝑏
=
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
)
×
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
)
a 
b
 =(a 
b/2
 )×(a 
b/2
 ).
If 
𝑏
b is odd, 
𝑎
𝑏
=
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
)
×
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
)
×
𝑎
a 
b
 =(a 
b/2
 )×(a 
b/2
 )×a.
Why Divide and Conquer?
The naive approach involves multiplying 
𝑎
a by itself 
𝑏
b times. However, the recursive approach reduces the number of multiplications by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, effectively making it faster.

Let me explain the expo function in the context of the "Count Good Numbers" question in a clear, step-by-step manner.

We are tasked with calculating 
𝑎
𝑏
a 
b
  (in this problem, 
𝑎
=
20
a=20 or 
𝑎
=
5
a=5 depending on the number of even or odd positions) as part of the solution. Here's how the expo function works without modulus:

The expo Function: Key Idea
The expo function is used to efficiently compute 
𝑎
𝑏
a 
b
  using Exponentiation by Squaring, which significantly reduces the number of multiplications. Instead of multiplying 
𝑎
a by itself 
𝑏
b times, we repeatedly square 
𝑎
a and reduce 
𝑏
b by half.

Steps
1. Start with the base and exponent
Given 
𝑎
=
20
a=20 or 
𝑎
=
5
a=5 (number of valid choices per position), and 
𝑏
=
𝑛
/
2
b=n/2 (number of even or odd positions), we want to compute 
𝑎
𝑏
a 
b
 .
2. Break 
𝑏
b into smaller parts
Exponentiation by squaring uses the property:
If 
𝑏
b is even: 
𝑎
𝑏
=
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
)
×
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
2
)
a 
b
 =(a 
b/2
 )×(a 
b/2
 ), or equivalently 
(
𝑎
×
𝑎
)
𝑏
/
2
(a×a) 
b/2
 .
If 
𝑏
b is odd: 
𝑎
𝑏
=
𝑎
×
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
/
2
)
×
(
𝑎
𝑏
/
/
2
)
a 
b
 =a×(a 
b//2
 )×(a 
b//2
 ), or equivalently 
𝑎
×
(
𝑎
×
𝑎
)
𝑏
/
/
2
a×(a×a) 
b//2
 .
3. Iterative approach
Start with result = 1 (because anything multiplied by 1 is itself).
Repeatedly square the base and halve the exponent:
If the exponent 
𝑏
b is odd, multiply result by the base 
𝑎
a (since one extra 
𝑎
a is left over).
Square the base to account for the halving of the exponent.
Divide the exponent by 2 (integer division).
Example: Compute 
2
0
5
20 
5
 
We want to compute 
2
0
5
20 
5
  using Exponentiation by Squaring.

Start with:

base = 20, exponent = 5, result = 1.
Step 1: 
𝑏
=
5
b=5 (odd)

Multiply result by base: 
𝑟
𝑒
𝑠
𝑢
𝑙
𝑡
=
1
×
20
=
20
result=1×20=20.
Square the base: 
𝑏
𝑎
𝑠
𝑒
=
20
×
20
=
400
base=20×20=400.
Halve the exponent: 
𝑏
=
5
/
/
2
=
2
b=5//2=2.
Step 2: 
𝑏
=
2
b=2 (even)

Do not update result since 
𝑏
b is even.
Square the base: 
𝑏
𝑎
𝑠
𝑒
=
400
×
400
=
160000
base=400×400=160000.
Halve the exponent: 
𝑏
=
2
/
/
2
=
1
b=2//2=1.
Step 3: 
𝑏
=
1
b=1 (odd)

Multiply result by base: 
𝑟
𝑒
𝑠
𝑢
𝑙
𝑡
=
20
×
160000
=
3200000
result=20×160000=3200000.
Square the base: 
𝑏
𝑎
𝑠
𝑒
=
160000
×
160000
=
25600000000
base=160000×160000=25600000000.
Halve the exponent: 
𝑏
=
1
/
/
2
=
0
b=1//2=0.
Step 4: 
𝑏
=
0
b=0

Stop. The final result = 3200000.

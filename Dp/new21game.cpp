1. Problem Statement in Detail
Alice plays a game where she starts with 0 points and aims not to exceed k points. She draws numbers between 1 and maxPts (inclusive) uniformly at random. The game ends when her total points reach or exceed k.

She wins if her score is less than or equal to n when the game ends.
We need to calculate the probability of Alice winning the game.

Input Parameters:

n (int): Maximum score Alice can have to win.
k (int): Minimum score required to stop the game.
maxPts (int): Maximum points Alice can draw in one turn.
Output:

A float value representing the probability of Alice winning the game.
2. Testcase Explanation
Testcase 1:
Input:
n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output:
1.00000

Explanation:
Alice stops drawing immediately after the first turn since k = 1. Her score will always be between 1 and 10, which is always less than or equal to n = 10. Therefore, she always wins.

Testcase 2:
Input:
n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output:
0.60000

Explanation:
Alice draws one random number between 1 and 10. She wins if the number is 6 or less (since n = 6). Thus, the probability is 6/10 = 0.6.

3. Intuition (How it is a Question of Dynamic Programming)
This is a DP problem because:

The state at any score i depends on the probabilities of scores before it.
We compute the probabilities in a sequential manner, storing intermediate results for efficiency.
The problem can be solved by breaking it into overlapping subproblems, where the solution to one state helps in solving the next state.
4. Approach in Detail (Step-by-Step Solution)
State Definition:
Let dp[i] represent the probability of Alice reaching exactly i points.

Base Case:

If i = 0, then dp[0] = 1.0 (starting point).
Transition:
For scores i between 1 and k-1, the probability is determined by summing up the probabilities of all possible previous scores that could lead to i.

​
 
To compute this efficiently, we use a sliding window sum:

Keep a running sum of the last maxPts probabilities in a variable windowSum.
Use windowSum to compute the next dp[i].
Post k Scores:
After reaching k, Alice stops drawing cards. The final result is the sum of all probabilities for scores between k and n.

Algorithm:

Initialize dp[0] = 1.0.
Use a sliding window to compute probabilities up to k-1.
Accumulate the probabilities from k to n.
5. Code in C++
cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
    if (k == 0 || n >= k + maxPts) return 1.0;

    vector<double> dp(n + 1, 0.0);
    dp[0] = 1.0;
    double windowSum = 1.0, result = 0.0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = windowSum / maxPts;

        if (i < k) {
            windowSum += dp[i];
        } else {
            result += dp[i]; // Add probabilities of scores >= k
        }

        if (i >= maxPts) {
            windowSum -= dp[i - maxPts];
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10;
    cout << "Probability of winning: " << new21Game(n, k, maxPts) << endl;
    return 0;
}
6. Dry Run with the Code (Step-by-Step Explanation)
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Initialize dp array: dp[0] = 1.0.
Compute for i = 1:
dp[1] = windowSum / maxPts = 1.0 / 10 = 0.1.
Since i >= k, add dp[1] to result → result = 0.1.
Update windowSum → windowSum = 0.1.
Continue for i = 2, ..., n:
Repeat the sliding window logic until all probabilities are calculated.
Final result will be the sum of dp[k] to dp[n].
Final Output:
Probability = 1.00000.

7. Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:

Calculating probabilities for each score requires constant work due to the sliding window.
O(n) for scores from 0 to n.
Space Complexity:

Let me clarify the intuition behind the solution step by step:

3. Intuition (How it is a Question of Dynamic Programming)
The problem is about calculating the probability of reaching certain points while stopping at k and ensuring the total score doesn't exceed n. This is a DP problem because:

Overlapping Subproblems:
To calculate the probability of reaching a specific score i, we need to consider the probabilities of all possible previous scores that could lead to i. For example, to compute the probability of reaching i = 5, you add up probabilities of reaching i-1, i-2, ..., up to i-maxPts.

Recursive Relation:

From any score j, you can reach scores j+1, j+2, ..., up to j+maxPts (depending on how many points Alice draws in the game).
To calculate the probability of reaching i, you sum up the probabilities of all scores that can lead to i, and divide by maxPts (because each draw has an equal probability).

​
 
Sliding Window Optimization:
Calculating dp[i] directly by summing up probabilities of all valid previous scores would take too long. To speed this up:

Maintain a running sum (windowSum) of the last maxPts probabilities.
Use windowSum to compute dp[i] in constant time.
For example:
If dp[1] to dp[10] contribute to dp[11], store their sum in windowSum.
For dp[12], subtract dp[1] from windowSum and add dp[11].
Key Idea:

For scores less than k: Keep calculating probabilities using windowSum because Alice continues drawing cards.
For scores >= k: Alice stops drawing cards, so we accumulate these probabilities as part of the final result.
Let’s Break Down the Key Steps with an Example
Input: n = 6, k = 3, maxPts = 2
Step 1: Initialize Base Case
Alice always starts at 0 points: dp[0] = 1.0.
windowSum = dp[0] = 1.0.
Step 2: Compute dp[i] for i < k
For i = 1:
Alice can reach 1 by drawing 1 point from 0.

Step 3: Compute dp[i] for i >= k
At k = 3, Alice stops drawing cards.

Why This Approach Works
This problem boils down to probability distribution:

Each score i depends on the probabilities of reaching prior scores.
By keeping a running sum of the last maxPts probabilities, we efficiently compute the DP state without recalculating sums repeatedly.

Problem Statement Recap
We need to calculate the probability that Alice's total score is between k and n inclusive, given the rules of the game:

Alice starts with 0 points.
She repeatedly draws numbers from [1, maxPts].
She stops drawing numbers when her total score reaches at least k.
We solve this using dynamic programming.

Code in C++
cpp
Copy
Edit
double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
    // Base case: If Alice never starts drawing or she can draw endlessly
    if (k == 0 || n >= k + maxPts - 1) {
        return 1.0;
    }

    // dp[i] will store the probability of having exactly i points
    vector<double> dp(n + 1, 0.0);
    dp[0] = 1.0;  // Starting with 0 points has a probability of 1.0

    double windowSum = 1.0;  // Running sum for the sliding window of last maxPts probabilities
    double result = 0.0;     // To store the final probability result

    // Fill dp[i] for 1 <= i <= n
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Calculate dp[i] using the running sum of the last maxPts probabilities
        dp[i] = windowSum / maxPts;

        // If i < k, Alice can still draw, so keep updating windowSum
        if (i < k) {
            windowSum += dp[i];
        } else {
            // If i >= k, Alice stops drawing. Add dp[i] to the final result
            result += dp[i];
        }

        // If i >= maxPts, slide the window: remove the probability of dp[i - maxPts] from windowSum
        if (i >= maxPts) {
            windowSum -= dp[i - maxPts];
        }
    }

    return result;
}
Line-by-Line Explanation
1. Handle Edge Cases
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (k == 0 || n >= k + maxPts - 1) {
    return 1.0;
}
If k == 0: Alice stops drawing immediately (her score is always 0), so the probability of her score being ≤ n is 1.0.
If n >= k + maxPts - 1: This means no matter what Alice draws, her score will always fall within [k, n] when she stops drawing. Therefore, the answer is 1.0.
2. Define the DP Array
cpp
Copy
Edit
vector<double> dp(n + 1, 0.0);
dp[0] = 1.0;
dp[i] stores the probability of Alice having exactly i points.
Initialize dp[0] = 1.0 because Alice always starts with 0 points (with probability 1).
3. Define a Sliding Window
cpp
Copy
Edit
double windowSum = 1.0;
double result = 0.0;
windowSum is the sum of the last maxPts probabilities (dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ..., dp[i-maxPts]).
This allows us to compute dp[i] efficiently.
result will store the sum of probabilities where i >= k (because Alice stops drawing at these points).
4. Iterate Over Scores
cpp
Copy
Edit
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
This loop calculates the probability for each score i from 1 to n.
5. Update dp[i]
cpp
Copy
Edit
dp[i] = windowSum / maxPts;
The probability of reaching score i is the average probability of reaching any of the previous maxPts scores.

​
 
windowSum stores the sum of the last maxPts probabilities for efficiency.
6. Update windowSum for Future Scores
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (i < k) {
    windowSum += dp[i];
}
If i < k, Alice can continue drawing, so we add dp[i] to windowSum.
For example, if i = 2 and maxPts = 3, we need to include dp[2] in windowSum so it contributes to future probabilities.
7. Add Probabilities to Result for i >= k
cpp
Copy
Edit
else {
    result += dp[i];
}
If i >= k, Alice stops drawing.
We add dp[i] to the result because these probabilities directly contribute to the final answer.
8. Slide the Window
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (i >= maxPts) {
    windowSum -= dp[i - maxPts];
}
To maintain the windowSum for the last maxPts probabilities, subtract the oldest probability (dp[i - maxPts]) when i >= maxPts.
For example, if i = 4 and maxPts = 3, then dp[1] is no longer part of the valid window for dp[4].
9. Return the Result
cpp
Copy
Edit
return result;
After the loop, result contains the sum of probabilities where i >= k and i <= n.
Dry Run
Input: n = 6, k = 3, maxPts = 2
i	dp[i]	windowSum	result
0	1.0	1.0	0.0
1	0.5	1.5	0.0
2	0.75	2.25	0.0
3	1.125	2.625	1.125
4	1.3125	2.1875	2.4375
5	1.09375	1.09375	3.53125
6	0.546875	0.546875	4.078125
Final result = 4.078125.

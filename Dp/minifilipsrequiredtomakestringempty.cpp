Problem Statement:
You are given a binary string s (consisting of only '0' and '1'). You can perform two operations:

Flip one bit (turn '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'), costing 1 step.
Remove a contiguous substring of all '1's, costing 1 step.
The goal is to determine the minimum steps required to make the string empty.

Recurrence Relation Explained
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP):

State Definition:
Let dp[i] represent the minimum steps required to make the first i characters of the string s empty.

Recurrence Relation:
To compute dp[i], we can:

Option 1 (Flip Current Character):
Flip the i-th character. This costs 1 step, plus the steps for the first i-1 characters:

𝑑
𝑝
[
𝑖
]
=
𝑑
𝑝
[
𝑖
−
1
]
+
1
dp[i]=dp[i−1]+1
Option 2 (Remove a Contiguous Substring of '1's):
Suppose there is a contiguous substring of '1's ending at the i-th position.
Let the substring start at position j (i.e., s[j:i] is all '1').
Remove this entire substring in 1 step, and the cost becomes the steps required to clear the first j-1 characters:

𝑑
𝑝
[
𝑖
]
=
𝑑
𝑝
[
𝑗
−
1
]
+
1
dp[i]=dp[j−1]+1
Take the minimum of both options:

𝑑
𝑝
[
𝑖
]
=
min
⁡
(
𝑑
𝑝
[
𝑖
−
1
]
+
1
,
𝑑
𝑝
[
𝑗
−
1
]
+
1
)
dp[i]=min(dp[i−1]+1,dp[j−1]+1)
Simplified Dry Run
Let’s dry run with a binary string:
Input: s = "0111101"

Step 1: Initialization
We initialize dp[0] = 0 (empty string requires no steps).

Step 2: Calculate dp[i] for all i
Index 1 (s[0] = '0'):
Flipping the '0' costs 1.
dp[1] = 1
Index 2 (s[1] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[2] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
No contiguous '1' substring to remove.
dp[2] = 2
Index 3 (s[2] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[3] = dp[2] + 1 = 3.
Contiguous substring '11' (from index 2 to 3):
Remove '11': dp[3] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
dp[3] = 2
Index 4 (s[3] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[4] = dp[3] + 1 = 3.
Contiguous substring '111' (from index 2 to 4):
Remove '111': dp[4] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
dp[4] = 2
Index 5 (s[4] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[5] = dp[4] + 1 = 3.
Contiguous substring '1111' (from index 2 to 5):
Remove '1111': dp[5] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
dp[5] = 2
Index 6 (s[5] = '0'):
Flip the '0': dp[6] = dp[5] + 1 = 3.
No contiguous '1' substring to remove.
dp[6] = 3
Index 7 (s[6] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[7] = dp[6] + 1 = 4.
Contiguous substring '1' (from index 7 to 7):
Remove '1': dp[7] = dp[6] + 1 = 3.
dp[7] = 3
Final Answer:
dp[7] = 3

It takes 3 steps to make "0111101" empty.

Why the Recurrence Works
Flipping Characters:
This is the default fallback. Any character can always be flipped, so it is a valid option.

Removing Substrings:
Removing an entire contiguous block of '1's saves flipping each individual bit. Instead of flipping, we take advantage of the substring and "clear it" in 1 step.

Key Complexity:
Time Complexity:
Filling dp takes 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ) in the worst case because we may need to explore substrings of '1's ending at each position.

Space Complexity:
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) for the dp array.

I hope this clears up both the recurrence and the steps! Would you like me to re-explain any part?

Let me walk you through the code for the Minimum Steps to Convert Binary String step by step, with detailed explanation for every line.

Code in C++
cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int minSteps(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX); // Initialize dp array with a large value (infinity)
    dp[0] = 0; // Base case: no steps needed for an empty string

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Option 1: Flip the i-th character
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;

        // Option 2: Remove a contiguous substring of '1's ending at i-1
        if (s[i - 1] == '1') {
            int j = i - 1;
            while (j >= 0 && s[j] == '1') {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                j--; // Expand the '1' substring backwards
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
}

int main() {
    string s = "0111101";
    cout << "Minimum steps to convert the string: " << minSteps(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Line-by-Line Explanation
Input & Initialization
cpp
Copy
Edit
int n = s.size();
vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
dp[0] = 0;
n: Length of the input string s.
dp: A dynamic programming array of size n+1. dp[i] represents the minimum steps to make the first i characters empty.
dp[0] = 0: Base case — an empty string requires 0 steps.
Outer Loop: Iterate Over Each Character
cpp
Copy
Edit
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
We iterate over the string to calculate dp[i] for each position i.
Option 1: Flip the Current Character
cpp
Copy
Edit
dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
If we flip the current character (s[i-1]), the cost is dp[i-1] + 1.
Option 2: Remove a Substring of '1's
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (s[i - 1] == '1') {
    int j = i - 1;
    while (j >= 0 && s[j] == '1') {
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
        j--;
    }
}
Condition: This option is only relevant if the current character (s[i-1]) is '1'.
Find Contiguous '1's:
Start from the current position i-1 and move backward while the characters are '1'.
Cost: Remove the entire substring of '1's in 1 step. The total cost becomes dp[j] + 1, where j is the position just before the contiguous block.
Final Result
cpp
Copy
Edit
return dp[n];
After filling the dp array, the value at dp[n] gives the minimum steps required to make the entire string empty.
Dry Run of the Code
Let’s dry run with the input string:
Input: s = "0111101"

Initialization
dp = [0, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞]
n = 7

Processing Each Character
Index 1 (s[0] = '0'):
Flip the '0': dp[1] = dp[0] + 1 = 1.
dp = [0, 1, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞]
Index 2 (s[1] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[2] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
No contiguous substring of '1'.
dp = [0, 1, 2, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞]
Index 3 (s[2] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[3] = dp[2] + 1 = 3.
Contiguous substring '11':
Remove '11', dp[3] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
dp = [0, 1, 2, 2, ∞, ∞, ∞, ∞]
Index 4 (s[3] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[4] = dp[3] + 1 = 3.
Contiguous substring '111':
Remove '111', dp[4] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
dp = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, ∞, ∞, ∞]
Index 5 (s[4] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[5] = dp[4] + 1 = 3.
Contiguous substring '1111':
Remove '1111', dp[5] = dp[1] + 1 = 2.
dp = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ∞, ∞]
Index 6 (s[5] = '0'):
Flip the '0': dp[6] = dp[5] + 1 = 3.
dp = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, ∞]
Index 7 (s[6] = '1'):
Flip the '1': dp[7] = dp[6] + 1 = 4.
Contiguous substring '1':
Remove '1', dp[7] = dp[6] + 1 = 3.
dp = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
Final Output
dp[7] = 3
Answer: Minimum steps to make "0111101" empty is 3.

Why Does This Work?
The recurrence ensures every character has two valid options:
Flip it individually.
Leverage blocks of contiguous '1's for efficiency.
The while loop ensures you handle all contiguous substrings efficiently.

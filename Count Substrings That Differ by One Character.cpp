Problem: Count Substrings That Differ by One Character
Problem Statement: Given two strings s and t, count the number of substrings of s and t that differ by exactly one character. A substring is a contiguous block of characters within a string.

Key Idea:
Instead of brute force, we use a sliding window approach along with dynamic comparison. For every possible substring pair, we calculate the number of differences character by character. We stop as soon as the number of differences exceeds 1.

Iterate over all starting indices for substrings of s and t.
Use a nested loop to expand substrings character by character and count mismatches.
If exactly one mismatch is found, increment the result counter.
Approach:
Initialize count to 0 to keep track of the valid substring pairs.
Iterate through all possible starting points in s and t.
For each pair of starting points (i, j), compare substrings character by character:
Use two pointers to expand the substring in s and t.
Count the number of mismatched characters as you expand.
Stop expanding when mismatches exceed 1.
Add to count whenever the substring pair differs by exactly one character.
Dry Run Example:
Let s = "aba" and t = "baba".

Compare all possible substring pairs:
"a" vs "b": 1 mismatch → Count = 1.
"a" vs "a": 0 mismatches → Not valid.
"a" vs "b": 1 mismatch → Count = 2.
"ab" vs "ba": 2 mismatches → Stop expanding.
"aba" vs "baba": 1 mismatch → Count = 3.
Continue this process for all pairs of substrings.
Final Count: 6.

Code in C++:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
    int m = s.size(), n = t.size(), count = 0;

    // Iterate through all starting indices in s and t
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int mismatches = 0;

            // Expand the substrings from s[i] and t[j]
            for (int k = 0; i + k < m && j + k < n; k++) {
                if (s[i + k] != t[j + k]) mismatches++;

                // If mismatches exceed 1, stop expanding
                if (mismatches > 1) break;

                // If there's exactly one mismatch, count the substring
                if (mismatches == 1) count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    string s = "aba";
    string t = "baba";

    cout << "Count of substrings that differ by exactly one character: "
         << countSubstrings(s, t) << endl;

    return 0;
}
Explanation of the Code:
Outer Loops:

The two outer loops iterate through all starting indices of substrings in s and t.
Inner Loop:

The inner loop compares characters in the current substrings from s and t.
As soon as the mismatch count exceeds 1, the loop breaks to avoid unnecessary computation.
Mismatch Count:

If a substring pair has exactly one mismatch, increment the count.
Result:

Return the total count of valid substring pairs.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity:

Outer loops: O(m * n) where m and n are the lengths of s and t.
Inner loop: In the worst case, compares up to min(m, n) characters.
Total: O(m * n * min(m, n)).
Space Complexity:

O(1) additional space, as we only use variables to track mismatches and counts.
Output:
For s = "aba" and t = "baba", the output will be:

Count of substrings that differ by exactly one character: 6
This efficient approach avoids unnecessary comparisons and computes the result using a systematic exploration of all possible substring pairs.

Let’s go through a detailed dry run of the code with the input strings:

Input:
s = "aba"
t = "baba"

Step-by-Step Dry Run
We will compare substrings of s and t starting from all possible indices (i, j).

Initialization:
count = 0 (tracks the number of valid substrings differing by exactly one character).
Outer Loops:
Case 1: i = 0, j = 0 (starting with s[0] and t[0])
Expand substrings character by character:

Compare s[0] with t[0]:
s[0] = 'a', t[0] = 'b' → mismatch = 1 → valid, increment count = 1.
Expand to s[1] and t[1]:
s[1] = 'b', t[1] = 'a' → mismatch = 2 → stop expanding (invalid substring).
Result so far: count = 1

Case 2: i = 0, j = 1 (starting with s[0] and t[1])
Expand substrings character by character:

Compare s[0] with t[1]:
s[0] = 'a', t[1] = 'a' → mismatch = 0 → not valid.
Expand to s[1] and t[2]:
s[1] = 'b', t[2] = 'b' → mismatch = 0 → not valid.
Expand to s[2] and t[3]:
s[2] = 'a', t[3] = 'a' → mismatch = 0 → not valid.
Result so far: count = 1

Case 3: i = 0, j = 2 (starting with s[0] and t[2])
Expand substrings character by character:

Compare s[0] with t[2]:
s[0] = 'a', t[2] = 'b' → mismatch = 1 → valid, increment count = 2.
Expand to s[1] and t[3]:
s[1] = 'b', t[3] = 'a' → mismatch = 2 → stop expanding (invalid substring).
Result so far: count = 2

Expand to s[2] and t[1]:
s[2] = 'a', t[1] = 'a' → mismatch = 0 → not valid.
Result so far: count = 2

Case 6: i = 1, j = 1 (starting with s[1] and t[1])
Expand substrings character by character:

Compare s[1] with t[1]:

s[2] = 'a', t[2] = 'b' → mismatch = 2 → stop expanding (invalid substring).
Result so far: count = 3

Case 7: i = 1, j = 2 (starting with s[1] and t[2])
Expand substrings character by character:

Compare s[1] with t[2]:
s[1] = 'b', t[2] = 'b' → mismatch = 0 → not valid.
Expand to s[2] and t[3]:
s[2] = 'a', t[3] = 'a' → mismatch = 0 → not valid.
Result so far: count = 3

Case 8: i = 2, j = 0 (starting with s[2] and t[0])
Expand substrings character by character:

Compare s[2] with t[0]:
s[2] = 'a', t[0] = 'b' → mismatch = 1 → valid, increment count = 4.
Result so far: count = 4

Case 9: i = 2, j = 1 (starting with s[2] and t[1])

s[2] = 'a', t[2] = 'b' → mismatch = 1 → valid, increment count = 5.
Result so far: count = 5

Case 11: i = 2, j = 3 (starting with s[2] and t[3])
Expand substrings character by character:

Compare s[2] with t[3]:
s[2] = 'a', t[3] = 'a' → mismatch = 0 → not valid.
Final Result: count = 6

Explanation of the Logic:
Mismatch Count:

For every substring, the logic ensures we stop expanding as soon as the mismatch count exceeds 1.
Only substrings with exactly one mismatch contribute to the count.
Nested Loops:

The outer loops go over all starting points in s and t.
The inner loop expands substrings and compares characters.
Final Count:
For s = "aba" and t = "baba", the total valid substrings differing by exactly one character is 6.

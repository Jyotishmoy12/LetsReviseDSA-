Problem Restatement
Given an array of integers nums and a target sum target, we need to find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray where the sum is greater than or equal to target.

Approach
We will use a sliding window approach to calculate the sum of the current window, expanding the window until the sum is greater than or equal to target. When the sum exceeds or is equal to the target, we will shrink the window while maintaining the sum condition to minimize the subarray length.

class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();  // Size of the input array
        int minLength = INT_MAX;  // To store the minimum length of the subarray
        int sum = 0;  // To maintain the sum of the current window
        int i = 0;  // Left pointer of the sliding window
        int j = 0;  // Right pointer of the sliding window

        // Traverse the array with the right pointer
        while (j < n) {
            // Add the current element to the sum
            sum += nums[j];

            // If window sum is less than the target, expand the window
            if (sum < target) {
                j++;  // Move the right pointer
            } 
            // If window sum is greater than or equal to the target, try to shrink the window
            else {
                // While the sum is greater than or equal to the target
                while (sum >= target) {
                    // Update the minimal length of the subarray
                    minLength = min(minLength, j - i + 1);
                    
                    // Shrink the window by subtracting the left element and moving the left pointer
                    sum -= nums[i];
                    i++;
                }
                j++;  // Move the right pointer after shrinking the window
            }
        }

        // If no subarray was found, return 0, otherwise return the minimal length
        return minLength == INT_MAX ? 0 : minLength;
    }
};
Explanation of Code
Initialization:
minLength is initialized to INT_MAX because we are looking for the minimum value.
sum is used to track the sum of the current window between indices i (left) and j (right).
i and j are two pointers that represent the boundaries of the sliding window.
Main Logic:
We move j (right pointer) and keep adding elements to the sum.
If the sum is less than the target, we expand the window by moving j further to the right.
If the sum becomes greater than or equal to the target, we shrink the window by moving i (left pointer) to the right while maintaining the condition sum >= target.
Each time the sum satisfies the condition, we update the minimum length of the subarray.
Final Result:
If no valid subarray was found, return 0. Otherwise, return minLength, which holds the minimal length of any valid subarray found during the process.
Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

Both pointers i and j traverse the array once. Thus, the array is scanned at most twice.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables.

Dry Run with Example
Let's dry run this code with the test case:

Test Case:
nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3], target = 7

Step-by-Step Execution:

Initialization:

minLength = INT_MAX, sum = 0, i = 0, j = 0
First Iteration (j = 0):

sum += nums[0] = 2
sum = 2
sum < target, so expand the window by moving j++.
Second Iteration (j = 1):

sum += nums[1] = 3
sum = 5
sum < target, so expand the window by moving j++.
Third Iteration (j = 2):

sum += nums[2] = 1
sum = 6
sum < target, so expand the window by moving j++.
Fourth Iteration (j = 3):

sum += nums[3] = 2
sum = 8
sum >= target, so now we shrink the window:
minLength = min(INT_MAX, 3 - 0 + 1) = 4
sum -= nums[i] = 2 → sum = 6
Move i++ to shrink the window.
Fifth Iteration (j = 4):

sum += nums[4] = 4
sum = 10
sum >= target, so shrink the window:
minLength = min(4, 4 - 1 + 1) = 4
sum -= nums[i] = 3 → sum = 7
Shrink again:
minLength = min(4, 4 - 2 + 1) = 3
sum -= nums[i] = 1 → sum = 6
Move i++.
Sixth Iteration (j = 5):

sum += nums[5] = 3
sum = 9
sum >= target, so shrink the window:
minLength = min(3, 5 - 3 + 1) = 3
sum -= nums[i] = 2 → sum = 7
Shrink again:
minLength = min(3, 5 - 4 + 1) = 2
sum -= nums[i] = 4 → sum = 3
Move i++.
At the end of the process, the smallest subarray that satisfies the condition is [4, 3] with length 2.

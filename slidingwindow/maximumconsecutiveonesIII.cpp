Max Consecutive Ones III problem using a sliding window approach. I'll structure the code similar to the template you've followed before, and provide a dry run, intuition, and complexity analysis.

Problem:
Given a binary array nums and an integer k, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array if you can flip at most k 0s.

Intuition:
Use a sliding window to track the number of 0s in the current window.
As long as the number of 0s within the window is less than or equal to k, the window can grow (expand the window).
Once the number of 0s exceeds k, shrink the window by incrementing the start pointer (i) to reduce the number of 0s.
Track the maximum length of the window that satisfies the condition of having at most k 0s.
Approach:
Initialize two pointers i and j for the sliding window, both starting from the beginning of the array.
Use a variable zeroCount to track the number of 0s in the current window.
Expand the window by incrementing j. If the number of 0s exceeds k, shrink the window by moving i.
Track the maximum length of the valid window.
Code (following your template style):

class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int i = 0, j = 0; // Sliding window pointers
        int zeroCount = 0; // Count of zeros in the current window
        int maxLen = 0; // Maximum length of the window with at most k zeros
        int n = nums.size(); // Size of the array
        
        while (j < n) {
            // If we encounter a zero, increment the zeroCount
            if (nums[j] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
            
            // If the number of zeros exceeds k, shrink the window
            if (zeroCount > k) {
                if (nums[i] == 0) {
                    zeroCount--; // Reduce the zero count as we move past the zero
                }
                i++; // Shrink the window from the left
            }
            
            // Calculate the maximum length of the window
            maxLen = max(maxLen, j - i + 1);
            
            // Expand the window
            j++;
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
};
Dry Run:
Let's run through an example:

Example:
nums = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], k = 2

i	j	nums[j]	zeroCount	maxLen	Action
0	0	1	0	1	Expand j
0	1	1	0	2	Expand j
0	2	0	1	3	Expand j, increment zeroCount
0	3	0	2	4	Expand j, increment zeroCount
0	4	1	2	5	Expand j
0	5	1	2	6	Expand j
0	6	0	3	6	Too many 0s, start shrinking i
1	6	0	3	6	Shrink, move i to 1
2	6	0	2	6	Shrink, move i to 2, decrement zeroCount
2	7	1	2	6	Expand j
2	8	1	2	7	Expand j, update maxLen
2	9	1	2	8	Expand j, update maxLen
Result: maxLen = 8

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array nums. Each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window, once when shrinking the window).
Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

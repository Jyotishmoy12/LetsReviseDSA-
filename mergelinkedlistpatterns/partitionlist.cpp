To tackle the problem of partitioning a linked list around a given value x, we'll walk through the steps to solve it, provide a detailed dry run with an example, and include the intuition behind each part.

Problem Statement
Partition List: Given a linked list and a value x, partition the list such that all nodes with values less than x come before nodes with values greater than or equal to x.

Intuition
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use two separate lists:

Less List: Contains nodes with values less than x.
Greater or Equal List: Contains nodes with values greater than or equal to x.
After building these two lists, we will combine them:

The "less" list is followed by the "greater or equal" list.
Ensure the combined list is properly terminated.
Algorithm
Initialize Two Separate Lists:

Use two pointers (lessHead and greaterHead) to keep track of the heads of the two lists.
Use two more pointers (less and greater) to build these lists.
Traverse the Original List:

For each node, compare its value with x.
Add nodes with values less than x to the "less" list.
Add nodes with values greater than or equal to x to the "greater or equal" list.
Combine the Lists:

Link the end of the "less" list to the beginning of the "greater or equal" list.
Ensure the last node of the "greater or equal" list points to nullptr.



  ListNode* partitionList(ListNode* head, int x) {
    // Create dummy nodes for the less and greater lists
    ListNode lessHead(0);
    ListNode greaterHead(0);
    
    ListNode* less = &lessHead;
    ListNode* greater = &greaterHead;
    
    // Traverse the original list
    while (head != nullptr) {
        if (head->val < x) {
            less->next = head;
            less = less->next;
        } else {
            greater->next = head;
            greater = greater->next;
        }
        head = head->next;
    }
    
    // End of the greater list should be null
    greater->next = nullptr;
    
    // Combine the two lists
    less->next = greaterHead.next;
    
    // Return the combined list starting from the first node of the less list
    return lessHead.next;
}


Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:

O(n): We traverse the linked list once to partition it into the two lists, and then combine them.
Space Complexity:

O(1): We use only a constant amount of extra space for pointers, not counting the space used by the linked list itself.

Problem Statement:
You are given n ropes with different lengths. The task is to connect all the ropes into one rope such that the total cost of connecting the ropes is minimized. The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths. After connecting the two ropes, they become one, and the process continues until only one rope remains.

The goal is to find the minimum cost of connecting all the ropes.

Example:
Input:

makefile
Copy code
Ropes: [4, 3, 2, 6]
Output:

makefile
Copy code
Cost: 29
Explanation:

Connect the two shortest ropes: 2 and 3 → cost = 5, new ropes: [4, 6, 5]
Connect the two shortest ropes: 4 and 5 → cost = 9, new ropes: [6, 9]
Connect the remaining two ropes: 6 and 9 → cost = 15, new ropes: [15]
Total cost = 5 + 9 + 15 = 29
Intuition:
The main idea to minimize the cost is to always connect the two smallest ropes first. This minimizes the immediate cost and ensures that the overall cost remains as low as possible. This is because the cost of connecting two ropes is the sum of their lengths, and if we delay connecting large ropes, we can avoid increasing the cost significantly.

Thus, we can use a greedy approach to solve this problem efficiently.

Approach:
Use a Min-Heap: A min-heap (priority queue) is ideal for this problem because it allows us to quickly extract the two smallest ropes, which we need to connect first.

Steps:

Insert all rope lengths into the min-heap.
While there are more than one rope in the heap:
Extract the two smallest ropes.
Connect them, compute the cost, and insert the new rope (with the sum of the two lengths) back into the heap.
Repeat this process until only one rope remains.
Final Answer: The total cost of all the connections will be the sum of all the costs incurred during the process.

C++ Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int minCostToConnectRopes(vector<int>& ropes) {
    // Step 1: Create a min-heap (priority queue) to store the rope lengths
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;

    // Step 2: Insert all rope lengths into the heap
    for (int rope : ropes) {
        minHeap.push(rope);
    }

    int totalCost = 0;

    // Step 3: While there is more than one rope, keep connecting the smallest two
    while (minHeap.size() > 1) {
        // Extract the two smallest ropes
        int rope1 = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        int rope2 = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();

        // Cost of connecting the two ropes
        int cost = rope1 + rope2;
        totalCost += cost;

        // Insert the new rope (the sum of the two) back into the heap
        minHeap.push(cost);
    }

    return totalCost;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> ropes = {4, 3, 2, 6};
    cout << "Minimum cost to connect ropes: " << minCostToConnectRopes(ropes) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Dry Run:
Let's dry run the example with ropes [4, 3, 2, 6]:

Initial Heap: {2, 3, 4, 6} (min-heap order)

First Iteration:

Extract the two smallest ropes: 2 and 3.
Cost = 2 + 3 = 5.
Insert the new rope (5) back into the heap.
New heap: {4, 5, 6}.
Total cost = 5.
Second Iteration:

Extract the two smallest ropes: 4 and 5.
Cost = 4 + 5 = 9.
Insert the new rope (9) back into the heap.
New heap: {6, 9}.
Total cost = 5 + 9 = 14.
Third Iteration:

Extract the two smallest ropes: 6 and 9.
Cost = 6 + 9 = 15.
Insert the new rope (15) back into the heap.
New heap: {15}.
Total cost = 14 + 15 = 29.
Final Answer: The total cost of connecting the ropes is 29.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

Building the min-heap initially takes O(n log n), where n is the number of ropes.
Each of the n - 1 operations to extract two elements and insert one back into the heap takes O(log n).
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).
Space Complexity:

We are using a priority queue to store the ropes, which requires O(n) space.
Thus, the space complexity is O(n).

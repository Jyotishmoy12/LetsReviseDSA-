To solve the problem of finding the K closest points to the origin on a 2D plane, we can use a few different strategies. The simplest and efficient way is to use a min-heap or max-heap. Here's how we can approach the problem:

Approach:
Calculate the distance of each point from the origin (0, 0). The distance can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:

distance
=
𝑥
2
+
𝑦
2
distance= 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 
But since we're comparing distances, we can use the squared distance to avoid computing square roots, which is more efficient:

squared_distance
=
𝑥
2
+
𝑦
2
squared_distance=x 
2
 +y 
2
 
Use a heap: We can use a max-heap of size K to store the K closest points:

First, insert the first K points into the heap.
For each remaining point, compare its squared distance with the farthest point in the heap (i.e., the root of the max-heap). If the new point is closer, remove the farthest point and insert the new point into the heap.
Return the result: The heap will store the K closest points to the origin, so simply return the points from the heap.

Code Implementation in C++:

#include <iostream>

#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to calculate the squared distance from the origin
    int squaredDistance(const vector<int>& point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }

    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        // Max-heap to store the points and their squared distances
        priority_queue<pair<int, vector<int>>> maxHeap;

        // Step 1: Add the first k points to the max-heap
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int dist = squaredDistance(points[i]);
            
            if (maxHeap.size() < k) {
                maxHeap.push({dist, points[i]});
            } else if (dist < maxHeap.top().first) {
                maxHeap.pop();
                maxHeap.push({dist, points[i]});
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Extract the k closest points from the heap
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            result.push_back(maxHeap.top().second);
            maxHeap.pop();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<int>> points = {{1, 3}, {-2, 2}, {5, 8}, {0, 1}};
    int k = 2;
    
    vector<vector<int>> closestPoints = solution.kClosest(points, k);
    
    // Print the closest k points
    for (const auto& point : closestPoints) {
        cout << "[" << point[0] << ", " << point[1] << "]\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
squaredDistance function: This function calculates the squared distance of a point from the origin to avoid unnecessary computation of the square root.

Main Function (kClosest):

We use a max-heap (priority queue in C++) to store points.
We loop through all the points and for each point, calculate its squared distance from the origin.
If the size of the heap is less than k, we simply add the point. If the heap size is k, we compare the squared distance of the new point with the largest (farthest) point in the heap. If the new point is closer, we remove the farthest point and add the new one.
At the end, the heap contains the k closest points, which we extract and return.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity:
Calculating the squared distance for each point is 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1).
Inserting into a max-heap (of size k) takes 
𝑂
(
log

𝑘
)
O(logk).
For each of the n points, we perform either an insertion or a pop and push operation, leading to a total complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛

⁡
𝑘
)
O(nlogk).
Space Complexity:
We are storing up to k points in the heap, so the space complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑘
)
O(k).

Let's go through a detailed dry run of the solution step by step using the example input:

Input:
cpp
Copy
Edit
vector<vector<int>> points = {{1, 3}, {-2, 2}, {5, 8}, {0, 1}};
int k = 2;
Initial Setup:
The priority queue (max-heap) is initialized as empty: maxHeap = {}.
The result vector is also initialized as empty: result = {}.
Step 1: Calculating Squared Distances
We will calculate the squared distance of each point from the origin, which avoids computing the square root. The formula for the squared distance of a point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0) is:

squared_distance
=
𝑥
2

Step 2: Building the Max-Heap (Priority Queue)
We will now iterate through the points and insert them into the max-heap. The heap will store pairs of the form (squared_distance, point).

Iteration 1: Point (1, 3) (Squared distance = 10)
The heap size is less than k (heap size = 0, k = 2), so we simply insert the point into the heap.
Heap after this operation: maxHeap = {(10, {1, 3})}
Iteration 2: Point (-2, 2) (Squared distance = 8)
The heap size is still less than k (heap size = 1, k = 2), so we simply insert the point into the heap.
Heap after this operation: maxHeap = {(10, {1, 3}), (8, {-2, 2})}
Iteration 3: Point (5, 8) (Squared distance = 89)
The heap size is now k (heap size = 2, k = 2).
The new point has a squared distance of 89, which is greater than the smallest distance in the heap (8).
We compare the new point's squared distance with the root (largest element in the heap, which is the point with the largest squared distance). In this case, the root is (10, {1, 3}).
Since the new point (with squared distance 89) is farther, we pop the root (farthest point) and insert the new point into the heap.
Heap after this operation:
Pop (10, {1, 3})
Insert (89, {5, 8})
Heap after this operation: maxHeap = {(89, {5, 8}), (8, {-2, 2})}
Iteration 4: Point (0, 1) (Squared distance = 1)
The heap size is k (heap size = 2, k = 2).
The new point has a squared distance of 1, which is smaller than the largest squared distance in the heap (89).
We compare the new point's squared distance with the root of the heap, which is (89, {5, 8}).
Since the new point is closer to the origin, we pop the root (farthest point) and insert the new point into the heap.
Heap after this operation:
Pop (89, {5, 8})
Insert (1, {0, 1})
Heap after this operation: maxHeap = {(8, {-2, 2}), (1, {0, 1})}
Step 3: Extracting the K Closest Points
Now that we have processed all the points and the heap contains the K closest points, we can extract them from the heap.

The heap now contains the closest 2 points (K = 2): maxHeap = {(8, {-2, 2}), (1, {0, 1})}.
We will pop the elements from the heap and store them in the result vector.
Pop (8, {-2, 2}) → Add {-2, 2} to result.
Pop (1, {0, 1}) → Add {0, 1} to result.
At this point, the result vector will be:

cpp
Copy
Edit
result = {{-2, 2}, {0, 1}}
Final Output:
The result vector contains the k = 2 closest points to the origin.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

For each point, we perform a push or pop operation on the heap. The time complexity of each heap operation is 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑘
)
O(logk).
We perform this operation for all n points, so the overall time complexity is:
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑘
)
O(nlogk)
Space Complexity:

We store up to k points in the heap, so the space complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑘
)
O(k).
Conclusion:
The max-heap helps us efficiently keep track of the k closest points to the origin by removing the farthest point when a closer point is found. The solution efficiently finds the desired points in 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑘
)
O(nlogk) time and uses 
𝑂
(
𝑘
)
O(k) space.

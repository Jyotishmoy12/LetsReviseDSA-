Problem Statement
Problem:
Given three strings s1, s2, and result, determine if result is a valid shuffle of s1 and s2. A valid shuffle of two strings is defined as one where:

The length of result is equal to the sum of the lengths of s1 and s2.
All characters of s1 and s2 are interleaved in the same order as they appear in their respective strings.
Intuition
To determine if result is a valid shuffle of s1 and s2:

Think of s1 and s2 as two sequences being merged into result.
Use two pointers to iterate through s1 and s2 while checking whether characters in result correspond to those in s1 and s2 in the correct order.
Approach
Length Check:

If the length of result is not equal to the sum of the lengths of s1 and s2, return false.
Two Pointers:

Use two pointers, one for s1 (i) and one for s2 (j).
Traverse result with a separate pointer (k).
At each step, check if the current character of result matches the current character of either s1 or s2:
If it matches s1[i], move i forward.
If it matches s2[j], move j forward.
If it doesn't match either, return false.
Complete Traversal:

If all characters in result are consumed and the pointers i and j match the end of s1 and s2, return true.
Dry Run
Input:
text
Copy code
s1 = "abc"
s2 = "def"
result = "adbcef"
Step-by-Step Dry Run:
Length Check:

Length of result = 6, which equals length of s1 + length of s2 = 3 + 3 → Proceed.
Initialization:

Pointers: i = 0 (for s1), j = 0 (for s2), k = 0 (for result).
Traverse result:

Step 1:
result[k] = 'a', matches s1[i] = 'a'.
Move i to 1, k to 1.

Step 2:
result[k] = 'd', matches s2[j] = 'd'.
Move j to 1, k to 2.

Step 3:
result[k] = 'b', matches s1[i] = 'b'.
Move i to 2, k to 3.

Step 4:
result[k] = 'c', matches s1[i] = 'c'.
Move i to 3, k to 4.

Step 5:
result[k] = 'e', matches s2[j] = 'e'.
Move j to 2, k to 5.

Step 6:
result[k] = 'f', matches s2[j] = 'f'.
Move j to 3, k to 6.

End Check:

Both i and j have reached the end of s1 and s2 respectively, and all characters in result are consumed → Valid Shuffle.
Code in C++
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isValidShuffle(string s1, string s2, string result) {
    // Length check
    if (s1.length() + s2.length() != result.length()) {
        return false;
    }

    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

    // Traverse the result string
    while (k < result.length()) {
        if (i < s1.length() && result[k] == s1[i]) {
            i++;
        } else if (j < s2.length() && result[k] == s2[j]) {
            j++;
        } else {
            return false; // Mismatch found
        }
        k++;
    }

    // Ensure both s1 and s2 are fully traversed
    return i == s1.length() && j == s2.length();
}

int main() {
    string s1 = "abc";
    string s2 = "def";
    string result = "adbcef";

    if (isValidShuffle(s1, s2, result)) {
        cout << "The string is a valid shuffle of the two strings." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The string is not a valid shuffle of the two strings." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity:

The algorithm processes each character of result exactly once, resulting in 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
=
length of 
𝑟
𝑒
𝑠
𝑢
𝑙
𝑡
n=length of result.
Space Complexity:

The algorithm uses constant extra space (
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1)), as it only uses pointers and no additional data structures.
Output for Example:
text
Copy code
The string is a valid shuffle of the two strings.

Problem Statement
You are given a string s. Rearrange it such that no two adjacent characters are the same. If it’s not possible, return an empty string.

Approach
Key Idea: Use a Max Heap
The most frequent characters are the most likely to cause adjacent conflicts. To prevent this:
Use a max heap (priority queue) to greedily pick the character with the highest frequency and place it in the result.
To avoid placing the same character back-to-back:
Keep the character in a "waiting area" (temporarily unavailable) until it’s safe to reuse.
Continue this process until all characters are used, or it becomes impossible to arrange them.
Algorithm
Count Frequencies:
Count how many times each character appears.
Push into Max Heap:
Push characters into a max heap based on their frequency.
Construct Result:
Greedily pick the most frequent character, append it to the result, and reduce its frequency.
Temporarily store the last used character to prevent adjacent placement.
Check Feasibility:
If the heap is empty and there are still characters left to place, return an empty string.
Code
Here’s the code for this problem:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string rearrangeString(string s) {
    // Step 1: Count character frequencies
    unordered_map<char, int> freq;
    for (char c : s) freq[c]++;

    // Step 2: Use a max heap to store characters by frequency
    priority_queue<pair<int, char>> maxHeap;
    for (auto& [c, count] : freq) {
        maxHeap.push({count, c});
    }

    // Step 3: Rearrange the string
    string result = "";
    pair<int, char> prev = {0, '#'}; // Store the last used character

    while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
        auto [count, c] = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();

        // Append the character to the result
        result += c;

        // Reinsert the previous character into the heap if its count > 0
        if (prev.first > 0) {
            maxHeap.push(prev);
        }

        // Update prev with the current character (decrease its count)
        prev = {count - 1, c};
    }

    // Step 4: Check if the rearranged string is valid
    return result.size() == s.size() ? result : "";
}
Dry Run
Input:
plaintext
Copy code
s = "aabbcc"
Step 1: Frequency Count
Count the frequency of each character in s:

plaintext
Copy code
freq = {
    'a': 2,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 2
}
Step 2: Push into Max Heap
Push characters into the max heap (stored as negative frequency for max behavior):

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'c') ]
Step 3: Rearrange the String
We iteratively pick the most frequent character and update the heap.

Iteration 1:
Pop (2, 'a') from the heap.
Append 'a' to the result:
plaintext
Copy code
result = "a"
Decrease 'a''s frequency to 1 and store it as prev:
plaintext
Copy code
prev = (1, 'a')
Iteration 2:
Pop (2, 'b') from the heap.
Append 'b' to the result:
plaintext
Copy code
result = "ab"
Reinsert prev = (1, 'a') into the heap:
plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (2, 'c'), (1, 'a') ]
Update prev to (1, 'b').
Iteration 3:
Pop (2, 'c') from the heap.
Append 'c' to the result:
plaintext
Copy code
result = "abc"
Reinsert prev = (1, 'b') into the heap:
plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'a'), (1, 'b') ]
Update prev to (1, 'c').
Iteration 4:
Pop (1, 'a') from the heap.
Append 'a' to the result:
plaintext
Copy code
result = "abca"
Reinsert prev = (1, 'c') into the heap:
plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'b'), (1, 'c') ]
Update prev to (0, 'a').
Iteration 5:
Pop (1, 'b') from the heap.
Append 'b' to the result:
plaintext
Copy code
result = "abcab"
Reinsert prev = (1, 'c') into the heap:
plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'c') ]
Update prev to (0, 'b').
Iteration 6:
Pop (1, 'c') from the heap.
Append 'c' to the result:
plaintext
Copy code
result = "abcabc"
Update prev to (0, 'c').
Step 4: Validity Check
The length of result matches the input s, so the rearranged string is valid.

Final Result:
plaintext
Copy code
"abcabc"
Key Formulas and Intuitions
Heap Structure:

The max heap ensures that we always pick the character with the highest frequency first, reducing the chance of adjacent repeats.
prev Character:

Temporarily storing the previous character ensures that it’s not immediately reused, respecting the "no adjacent repetition" rule.
Reinsertion:

Characters with remaining frequencies are reinserted into the heap. This keeps track of characters that can still contribute to the result.
Feasibility:

If at any point we cannot pick a valid character and the heap is empty, it means the arrangement is not possible (e.g., "aaa").
Edge Cases
Impossible Case:
Input: "aaa"
Output: ""

Explanation: The most frequent character cannot be separated.
Single Character:
Input: "a"
Output: "a"

Already Valid:
Input: "ab"
Output: "ab" (or "ba")

Let’s redo the dry run step-by-step with even more clarity, aligning closely with the code and explaining the reasoning behind every action. We'll include intermediate states, why each step happens, and how the rules ensure no adjacent characters repeat.

Input Example
plaintext
Copy code
s = "aabbcc"
Step 1: Frequency Count
We first count the occurrences of each character in the string:

plaintext
Copy code
freq = {
    'a': 2,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 2
}
This tells us each character appears twice. The goal is to arrange these characters while ensuring no two adjacent characters are the same.

Step 2: Initialize Max Heap
We use a max heap (implemented with a priority queue). Each element is a pair: (frequency, character).

Why a max heap?

The most frequent character is the hardest to place without causing conflicts. The max heap lets us always pick the character with the highest frequency first.
Initial max heap:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (2, 'c') ]
The heap orders elements based on frequency. (Ties can be broken arbitrarily.)

Step 3: Rearrange the String
We will build the result step-by-step by:

Picking the character with the highest frequency.
Appending it to the result.
Temporarily "locking" the character so it doesn’t get placed again immediately.
Re-inserting it later when it's safe to use.
Initialization
Before starting the loop:

Result: Empty ("")
prev: (0, '#') (a dummy placeholder for the "locked" character)
Iteration 1:
Pop the character with the highest frequency from the heap:

plaintext
Copy code
(count, c) = (2, 'a')
Now:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (2, 'b'), (2, 'c') ]
Append 'a' to the result:

plaintext
Copy code
result = "a"
Temporarily "lock" 'a' by updating prev:

plaintext
Copy code
prev = (1, 'a')  # Reduce count by 1
Why lock 'a'?
To prevent placing it back-to-back.

Iteration 2:
Pop the next most frequent character:

plaintext
Copy code
(count, c) = (2, 'b')
Now:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (2, 'c') ]
Append 'b' to the result:

plaintext
Copy code
result = "ab"
Reinsert the locked 'a' back into the heap:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (2, 'c'), (1, 'a') ]
Update prev to lock 'b':

plaintext
Copy code
prev = (1, 'b')
Iteration 3:
Pop the next most frequent character:

plaintext
Copy code
(count, c) = (2, 'c')
Now:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'a') ]
Append 'c' to the result:

plaintext
Copy code
result = "abc"
Reinsert the locked 'b' back into the heap:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'a'), (1, 'b') ]
Update prev to lock 'c':

plaintext
Copy code
prev = (1, 'c')
Iteration 4:
Pop the next most frequent character:

plaintext
Copy code
(count, c) = (1, 'a')
Now:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'b') ]
Append 'a' to the result:

plaintext
Copy code
result = "abca"
Reinsert the locked 'c' back into the heap:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'b'), (1, 'c') ]
Update prev to lock 'a':

plaintext
Copy code
prev = (0, 'a')  # No need to reinsert since its count is now 0
Iteration 5:
Pop the next most frequent character:

plaintext
Copy code
(count, c) = (1, 'b')
Now:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'c') ]
Append 'b' to the result:

plaintext
Copy code
result = "abcab"
Reinsert the locked 'c' back into the heap:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = [ (1, 'c') ]
Update prev to lock 'b':

plaintext
Copy code
prev = (0, 'b')  # No need to reinsert since its count is now 0
Iteration 6:
Pop the last character:

plaintext
Copy code
(count, c) = (1, 'c')
Now:

plaintext
Copy code
maxHeap = []
Append 'c' to the result:

plaintext
Copy code
result = "abcabc"
Update prev:

plaintext
Copy code
prev = (0, 'c')
Step 4: Validity Check
The length of the result matches the input string, meaning the rearrangement is valid.

Final Result:

plaintext
Copy code
"abcabc"
Why These Formulas and Conditions?
Max Heap:

Ensures we prioritize the character with the highest frequency, minimizing the chance of adjacent repetitions.
Locking (prev):

Prevents immediately reusing the same character.
By reinserting it later, we maintain the character's order while ensuring safe placement.
Feasibility Check:

If the heap is empty before finishing the string, the rearrangement is impossible (e.g., "aaa").
Reinsertion of prev:

Characters are added back into the heap only after they're "safe" to use again.
Edge Cases
Impossible Case:

plaintext
Copy code
Input: "aaa"
Output: ""
Already Valid:

plaintext
Copy code
Input: "abc"
Output: "abc"
Single Character:

plaintext
Copy code
Input: "a"
Output: "a"

Problem Statement
Problem:
You are given a numeric string s. The task is to split this string into a list of prime numbers represented as substrings such that:

Each substring represents a valid prime number.
Leading zeros are not allowed.
The sum of all substrings is minimized.
Return the number of possible ways to split the string into valid primes.
Intuition
Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. The challenge here is to split the string into valid prime substrings while adhering to the constraints (no leading zeros, all numbers must be prime). The problem requires exploring all possible partitions of the string and verifying whether each partition forms valid primes.

Backtracking is a natural choice for this problem because:

It allows us to explore all possible partitions of the string.
At each step, we check if the current substring is a valid prime.
We continue building the partition if valid, otherwise backtrack.
Approach
Generate Primes Efficiently:
Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute all prime numbers up to a certain limit (e.g., 10‚Å∂ since the string's numeric value will be less than this).

Backtracking:

Start from the beginning of the string.
For each position, extract substrings of varying lengths.
Check if the substring represents a valid prime number (using the precomputed primes).
If valid, recursively explore the rest of the string.
Keep a count of all valid ways to split the string.
Avoid Invalid Substrings:

Substrings with leading zeros are invalid.
Substrings larger than the upper limit of precomputed primes (10‚Å∂) are invalid.
Dry Run
Input:
s = "31373"

Step 1: Precompute Primes
Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, generate all primes up to 10‚Å∂.

Step 2: Backtracking
Start with an empty partition and recursively try to split the string.

First Partition:
Try substrings of increasing length: "3", "31", "313", "3137", "31373".

"3" is prime ‚Üí Recur on "1373".
"31" is prime ‚Üí Recur on "373".
"313" is prime ‚Üí Recur on "73".
"3137" is prime ‚Üí Recur on "3".
"31373" is not prime.
Second Partition (from "1373"):

"1" is invalid (not prime).
"13" is prime ‚Üí Recur on "73".
"137" is prime ‚Üí Recur on "3".
"1373" is not prime.
Output of Dry Run:
Valid splits:

[3, 13, 73]
[31, 373]
[313, 73]
Total ways to split: 3.

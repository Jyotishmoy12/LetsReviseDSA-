Problem Statement
Given a string path representing an absolute Unix-style file path, simplify the path. The simplified path must adhere to the following rules:

A single / separates directory names.
"." refers to the current directory and can be ignored.
".." moves up one directory. If already at the root (/), ignore "..".
Extra / should be treated as a single /.
The final simplified path should always start with /.
Input Examples
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"

Output: "/c"
Explanation:
Start at /.
Go to /a.
Ignore ".".
Go to /b.
Use ".." to go back to /a.
Use ".." again to return to /.
Finally, go to /c.
Input: "/../"

Output: "/"
Explanation:
".." cannot go above root, so it stays at /.
Input: "/home//foo/"

Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation:
Remove extra /.
Intuition
To simplify a Unix path, we need to process each segment (separated by /) and handle it based on its meaning:

If the segment is "" or ".": Ignore it (it's redundant).
If the segment is "..": Pop the top directory from the stack (if any).
If the segment is a valid directory name: Push it onto the stack.
Finally, join the stack contents to form the simplified path.
We use a stack because it allows us to handle the ".." operation efficiently (last-in, first-out behavior).

Approach
Initialize a stack: This will hold valid directory names as we process the path.
Use a stringstream to split the path into segments separated by /.
Each segment represents either:
A directory name (to be added to the stack),
"." (to be ignored),
".." (to pop the last directory), or
"" (to be ignored).
Process each segment:
If it's "" or ".", ignore it.
If it's ".." and the stack is not empty, pop the last directory.
Otherwise, push the segment onto the stack (valid directory name).
Reconstruct the path:
Use the stack to build the final path. Each directory in the stack represents part of the simplified path.
Edge cases:
Empty path: Should return /.
Excessive "..": Should not go above root.
Multiple /: Treat as a single /.
Code
Hereâ€™s the C++ implementation:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        stack<string> stk;                // Stack to store directory names
        stringstream ss(path);            // Stringstream to split the path
        string token;                     // Each segment of the path
        
        // Split the path by '/'
        while (getline(ss, token, '/')) {
            if (token == "" || token == ".") {
                // Ignore empty segments and "."
                continue;
            } else if (token == "..") {
                // ".." means go up one directory
                if (!stk.empty()) {
                    stk.pop();
                }
            } else {
                // Valid directory name, push onto the stack
                stk.push(token);
            }
        }

        // Build the simplified path from the stack
        string result = "";
        while (!stk.empty()) {
            result = "/" + stk.top() + result;
            stk.pop();
        }
        
        // Return the root "/" if result is empty
        return result.empty() ? "/" : result;
    }
};
Detailed Dry Run
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
Initialization:

stk = [] (empty stack).
path = "/a/./b/../../c/".
Use stringstream to split the path into segments based on /.
Process Each Segment:

Segment 1: "" (empty)

Ignore it.
Stack remains: [].
Segment 2: "a"

Push "a" onto the stack.
Stack becomes: ["a"].
Segment 3: "."

Ignore it (current directory).
Stack remains: ["a"].
Segment 4: "b"

Push "b" onto the stack.
Stack becomes: ["a", "b"].
Segment 5: ".."

Pop "b" from the stack (go one directory up).
Stack becomes: ["a"].
Segment 6: ".."

Pop "a" from the stack (go one directory up).
Stack becomes: [].
Segment 7: "c"

Push "c" onto the stack.
Stack becomes: ["c"].
Segment 8: "" (empty)

Ignore it.
Stack remains: ["c"].
Build the Result:

Pop "c" from the stack and prepend it to result.
result = "/c".
Stack is now empty.
Final Output: "/c".

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:

Splitting the path: O(n) (where n is the length of the path).
Processing the stack: O(k) (where k is the number of valid segments).
Overall: O(n).
Space Complexity:

Stack space: O(k) (for valid directory names).
Overall: O(k).
Example Outputs
Input	Output
"/a/./b/../../c/"	"/c"
"/../"	"/"
"/home//foo/"	"/home/foo"
"/a/./b/../c/"	"/a/c"

Sure! Let's use another test case and go through the detailed explanation step by step:

Test Case
Input: "/home//foo/./bar/../baz"
Step-by-Step Explanation
Initialization:
stk = [] (empty stack).
path = "/home//foo/./bar/../baz".
Use stringstream to split the path into segments based on /.
Process Each Segment:
We process each segment of the path one by one:

Segment 1: "" (empty)
Ignore it (redundant segment caused by the leading /).
Stack remains: [].
Segment 2: "home"
Push "home" onto the stack.
Stack becomes: ["home"].
Segment 3: "" (empty)
Ignore it (redundant segment caused by the double //).
Stack remains: ["home"].
Segment 4: "foo"
Push "foo" onto the stack.
Stack becomes: ["home", "foo"].
Segment 5: "."
Ignore it (represents the current directory).
Stack remains: ["home", "foo"].
Segment 6: "bar"
Push "bar" onto the stack.
Stack becomes: ["home", "foo", "bar"].
Segment 7: ".."
Pop "bar" from the stack (go one directory up).
Stack becomes: ["home", "foo"].
Segment 8: "baz"
Push "baz" onto the stack.
Stack becomes: ["home", "foo", "baz"].
Reconstruct the Path
Now, we use the stack to build the simplified path:

Start with an empty result = "".
Pop "baz" from the stack and prepend it to result:
result = "/baz".
Pop "foo" from the stack and prepend it to result:
result = "/foo/baz".
Pop "home" from the stack and prepend it to result:
result = "/home/foo/baz".
The stack is now empty.

Final Output
The simplified path is:
"/home/foo/baz"

Dry Run of Code
Letâ€™s walk through the code using this test case:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string simplifyPath(string path) {
        stack<string> stk;                // Stack to store directory names
        stringstream ss(path);            // Stringstream to split the path
        string token;                     // Each segment of the path
        
        // Split the path by '/'
        while (getline(ss, token, '/')) {
            if (token == "" || token == ".") {
                continue;                 // Ignore empty segments and "."
            } else if (token == "..") {
                if (!stk.empty()) {       // Pop from the stack if ".." is found
                    stk.pop();
                }
            } else {
                stk.push(token);          // Push valid directory names onto the stack
            }
        }

        // Build the simplified path from the stack
        string result = "";
        while (!stk.empty()) {
            result = "/" + stk.top() + result;
            stk.pop();
        }
        
        return result.empty() ? "/" : result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string path = "/home//foo/./bar/../baz";
    cout << sol.simplifyPath(path) << endl;  // Output: /home/foo/baz
}
Key Observations
Handling "..":

If ".." is encountered and the stack is not empty, we pop the top directory. This effectively means going one directory up.
If the stack is empty, we stay at the root (/).
Handling "." and "":

"." is ignored because it refers to the current directory.
"" is ignored because it's caused by extra /.
Building the result:

The stack contents are joined with / to form the final path.
If the stack is empty, we return /.
Edge Cases to Note
Empty path:
Input: "/"

Output: "/"
Explanation: Nothing to simplify.
Only "..":
Input: "/../"

Output: "/"
Explanation: Cannot go above root.
Double or multiple /:
Input: "/home//foo/"

Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: Extra / is ignored.

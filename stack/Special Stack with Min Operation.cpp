Problem Statement: Special Stack with Min Operation
You are tasked with implementing a special stack that supports the following operations in constant time (O(1)):

push(x): Pushes an element onto the stack.
pop(): Removes the top element from the stack.
top(): Retrieves the top element of the stack.
getMin(): Retrieves the minimum element in the stack at any point.
The goal is to design the stack such that all operations, including retrieving the minimum element, work in constant time without sorting or additional traversals.

Intuition
The key to solving this problem is to use an auxiliary stack (let's call it minStack) in addition to the primary stack (stack):

The primary stack (stack) stores all the elements in the order they are pushed.
The auxiliary stack (minStack) keeps track of the minimum elements at every stage of the stack operations.
For every operation:

Push: When we push a new element onto the stack, we also push the minimum of the current element and the top of the minStack onto the minStack. This ensures that the top of the minStack always contains the minimum element.
Pop: When we pop an element from the stack, we also pop from the minStack.
GetMin: The top of the minStack gives us the minimum element in constant time.
Approach
Data Structures:

Use two stacks:
stack: For normal stack operations.
minStack: To keep track of the minimum values.
Push Operation:

Push the element onto stack.
Push the minimum of the current element and the top of minStack onto minStack.
Pop Operation:

Pop the top element from both stack and minStack.
Top Operation:

Return the top of the stack.
GetMin Operation:

Return the top of the minStack.

Here’s how you can implement the getMin, pop, and push functions for a stack that keeps track of the minimum element in constant time:

We use a trick: Instead of using an auxiliary stack, we encode information about the minimum element directly in the values we push to the stack.

Approach
Tracking the Minimum:

Maintain an integer minEle to store the minimum element at any point in the stack.
Push Operation:

If the stack is empty, initialize minEle with the first element and push it normally.
If the element x being pushed is smaller than the current minEle:
Push a special encoded value onto the stack to preserve the previous minEle.
Update minEle to the new element.
Pop Operation:

If the top of the stack is the special encoded value, it means the top element corresponds to the current minEle.
Pop the top value and decode the previous minEle from the special value.
Otherwise, pop the top element normally.
GetMin Operation:

Simply return minEle as it always contains the minimum element.
Code Implementation
cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
    int minEle;       // Stores the minimum element in the stack
    stack<int> s;     // The main stack

public:

    /* Returns the minimum element from the stack */
    int getMin() {
        if (s.empty()) {
            return -1;  // Stack is empty
        }
        return minEle;
    }

    /* Removes and returns the top element from the stack */
    int pop() {
        if (s.empty()) {
            return -1;  // Stack is empty
        }

        int top = s.top();
        s.pop();

        // If the popped element is the special encoded value
        if (top < minEle) {
            int originalMin = minEle;  // Current minimum
            minEle = 2 * minEle - top; // Restore the previous minimum
            return originalMin;        // Return the original minimum
        }

        return top; // Otherwise, return the top element
    }

    /* Pushes an element x into the stack */
    void push(int x) {
        if (s.empty()) {
            s.push(x);
            minEle = x;  // Initialize minEle with the first element
        } else if (x < minEle) {
            // Push a special encoded value when x < minEle
            s.push(2 * x - minEle);
            minEle = x;  // Update minEle to the new minimum
        } else {
            s.push(x);  // Push normally
        }
    }
};
Explanation
Push Operation:

If x >= minEle, push x onto the stack normally.
If x < minEle, push a special encoded value 2 * x - minEle onto the stack. This ensures we can retrieve the previous minimum when we pop.
Pop Operation:

If the top element is the special encoded value, we decode the previous minEle using the formula:
minEle
=
2
×
current minEle
−
encoded value
minEle=2×current minEle−encoded value
GetMin Operation:

Simply return the current minEle.

Test Case:

push(10), push(20), push(5), getMin(), pop(), getMin(), pop(), getMin()
Step-by-Step Execution:
Push 10:

stack = [10]
minEle = 10
Push 20:

Since 20 >= minEle, push 20 normally.
stack = [10, 20]
minEle = 10
Push 5:

Since 5 < minEle, push 2 * 5 - 10 = 0 (encoded value).
Update minEle = 5.
stack = [10, 20, 0]
minEle = 5
GetMin():

Return minEle = 5.
Pop():

Top of stack is 0 (special encoded value).
Decode previous minEle:
minEle
=
2
×
5
−
0
=
10
minEle=2×5−0=10
stack = [10, 20]
minEle = 10
Return 5.
GetMin():

Return minEle = 10.
Pop():

Top of stack is 20.
stack = [10]
minEle = 10
Return 20.
GetMin():

Return minEle = 10.

The formula 2 * x - minEle is used in this problem to maintain the minimum element in the stack without requiring an additional stack to keep track of it. Let me explain the intuition behind it more clearly.

Why do we need this formula?
To understand why this formula is required, let’s first break down the core problem:

We need to design a stack that allows us to perform push, pop, and getMin operations in constant time 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1).
When we pop an element, we need to know whether the popped element was the current minimum. If it was, we need to restore the previous minimum value, which could be tricky if we only had a single stack.
The key challenge here is how to track the minimum element efficiently when popping elements, and we do this by encoding the minimum element information into the pushed elements. Here's how:

Key Idea:
When we push an element into the stack, if that element is smaller than the current minimum (minEle), we want to encode the old minimum so that we can retrieve it when popping the element. This is done using the formula 2 * x - minEle.

Let’s break down the logic:

When we push an element:

If the element 
𝑥
x is smaller than the current minEle, instead of just pushing the element 
𝑥
x, we push a special encoded value:
encoded value
=
2
×
𝑥
−
minEle
encoded value=2×x−minEle
This encoding ensures that we can decode the previous minimum when popping.
When we pop an element:

If the popped element is smaller than the current minEle, it means it was an encoded value representing the old minimum.
To recover the old minimum from the encoded value, we use the formula:
old minEle
=
2
×
current minEle
−
encoded value
old minEle=2×current minEle−encoded value
This allows us to restore the previous minimum efficiently.
Why does the formula work?
When we push an element 
𝑥
x that is smaller than the current minEle, we want to know the old minEle when we pop 
𝑥
x from the stack.
The encoded value 2 * x - minEle carries enough information to restore the minEle before pushing 
𝑥
x.
For example:

Suppose minEle = 10, and you push 
𝑥
=
5
x=5, which is smaller than the current minimum.

The encoded value would be:

encoded value
=
2
×
5
−
10
=
0
encoded value=2×5−10=0
Later, when we pop the top of the stack and encounter 0, we know it was encoded, so we decode it to get the previous minimum:

minEle
=
2
×
10
−
0
=
10
minEle=2×10−0=10
This formula allows us to preserve the minimum element in constant space, without needing an auxiliary stack.

Walkthrough with an Example:
Let's walk through the steps with an example to clarify:

Stack Operations:
Push 10:
stack = [10]
minEle = 10

Push 20:
stack = [10, 20]
minEle = 10 (no change because 20 is not smaller than 10)

Push 5:

Here, 5 is smaller than minEle = 10, so we push a special encoded value.
encoded value = 2 * 5 - 10 = 0
stack = [10, 20, 0]
minEle = 5 (update minimum to 5)
Pop:

The top of the stack is 0 (the encoded value), so we decode it to find the previous minimum.
minEle = 2 * 5 - 0 = 10
stack = [10, 20]
minEle = 10 (restore the previous minimum)
Return 5 (the popped value).
Pop:

The top of the stack is 20, which is not an encoded value.
stack = [10]
minEle = 10 (no change)
Return 20.
Pop:

The top of the stack is 10, the only element left.
stack = []
minEle = 10 (no change)
Return 10.
Key Takeaway:
The formula 2 * x - minEle is used to encode the old minimum value when we push an element smaller than the current minimum. This ensures that when we pop such an element, we can easily decode the previous minimum in constant time, enabling efficient tracking of the minimum element in the stack.

I hope this clears up the intuition behind using the formula! Let me know if you have any more questions. 😊

minEle=2×10−0=10  how?

Great question! Let's go over the formula and this specific step again to make sure everything is clear.

Understanding the Formula:
We are trying to decode the previous minimum value stored in the stack when we encounter an encoded value.

When we push an element smaller than the current minEle into the stack, we use the formula:

encoded value
=
2
×
𝑥
−
minEle
encoded value=2×x−minEle
Where:

𝑥
x is the element being pushed, and
minEle is the current minimum element in the stack.
Now, when we pop the encoded value, we need to retrieve the previous minimum (minEle) before the push operation. To do this, we use the following formula:

old minEle
=
2
×
current minEle
−
encoded value
old minEle=2×current minEle−encoded value
The encoded value was calculated earlier as 
2
×
𝑥
−
minEle
2×x−minEle, so we use it to reverse the process and find the old minimum.

Step-by-Step Example:
Let’s use this step-by-step example:

Initial State:
minEle = 10 (before pushing 5)
We are going to push 5, which is smaller than minEle.
Push Operation for 5:
Calculate the encoded value when pushing 5:

encoded value
=
2
×
5
−
10
=
0
encoded value=2×5−10=0
So, we push the value 0 into the stack (instead of 5).

The stack now looks like this:

stack
=
[
10
,
20
,
0
]
(
minEle is updated to 5
)
stack=[10,20,0](minEle is updated to 5)
After pushing 0, we update minEle to 5 (because 5 is the new minimum).

Pop Operation:
Now, when we pop the top of the stack (which is 0), we need to decode it to get the previous minimum value.

The value we popped is 0, which was an encoded value representing the old minimum.
To get the old minimum, we apply the formula:

old minEle
=
2
×
current minEle
−
encoded value
old minEle=2×current minEle−encoded value
Substituting the values:

old minEle
=
2
×
5
−
0
=
10
old minEle=2×5−0=10
So, the previous minEle (before we pushed 5) was 10.

Now we restore minEle to 10.

Final Stack State After Popping:
After popping the encoded value 0, we restore minEle to 10, and the stack looks like this:

stack
=
[
10
,
20
]
stack=[10,20]
The value 5 is not in the stack anymore, but we successfully restored the minimum value to 10.

Why Does It Work?
The formula 2 * x - minEle works because it encodes the old minimum when pushing a new element smaller than the current minimum, and allows us to recover that minimum when popping the encoded value. The formula preserves the previous minEle in a way that can be decoded later, without needing an additional stack for storing the minimums.

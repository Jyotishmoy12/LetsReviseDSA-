1. Find Next Greater Element for Elements of Array A in Array B
Problem Statement:
You are given two arrays, A and B. For each element in array A, find its next greater element in array B.
The next greater element of an element x in array B is the first element greater than x that appears to the right of x in B. If it does not exist, return -1.

Input:

Array A of size n: The array for which we need to find next greater elements.
Array B of size m: The array in which the next greater element will be searched.
Note: B is a superset of A, meaning all elements in A are guaranteed to appear in B.
Output:

An array of size n, where each element is the next greater element of the corresponding element in A.
If no next greater element exists, return -1 for that element.
Key Intuition:
The problem can be efficiently solved using a stack to keep track of elements for which we are still looking for the next greater element.
By iterating over array B, we can preprocess the next greater elements for all numbers in B and store them in a hash map. This allows for constant-time lookups when determining the results for array A.
The stack is used to maintain a decreasing sequence of elements, ensuring that the element at the top is always waiting for its next greater element.
Approach:
Step 1: Preprocess B using a stack to determine the next greater element for all elements in B.

Use a hash map (nge_map) to store the mapping of each element in B to its next greater element.
Traverse B from left to right:
If the current element is greater than the element on top of the stack, the current element is the next greater element for the top of the stack. Pop the stack and update the hash map.
Push the current element onto the stack.
After finishing the traversal, any elements left in the stack have no next greater element, so map them to -1.
Step 2: Use the preprocessed nge_map to find the next greater element for each element in A.

Simply look up each element of A in nge_map.
Algorithm:
Initialize an empty stack and an empty hash map nge_map.
Traverse B:
While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the stack's top element:
Pop the stack.
Map the popped element to the current element in nge_map.
Push the current element onto the stack.
After traversal, map all remaining elements in the stack to -1 in nge_map.
Traverse A and for each element, use nge_map to find its next greater element.
Code in C++:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        unordered_map<int, int> nge_map; // Map to store the next greater elements for all elements in B
        stack<int> s; // Stack to find next greater elements

        // Step 1: Preprocess B to find next greater elements
        for (int num : B) {
            while (!s.empty() && s.top() < num) {
                nge_map[s.top()] = num; // Map the top of the stack to the current number
                s.pop(); // Pop the element from the stack
            }
            s.push(num); // Push the current element onto the stack
        }

        // Remaining elements in the stack have no next greater element
        while (!s.empty()) {
            nge_map[s.top()] = -1; // Map them to -1
            s.pop();
        }

        // Step 2: Find next greater elements for A using nge_map
        vector<int> result;
        for (int num : A) {
            result.push_back(nge_map[num]); // Lookup in the hash map
        }
        return result;
    }
};
Dry Run:
Input:
A = [4, 1, 2], B = [1, 3, 4, 2]

Step 1: Preprocessing B:

Initialize an empty stack and nge_map = {}.
Traverse B:
Current Element	Stack	nge_map	Explanation
1	[1]	{}	Push 1 since stack is empty.
3	[3]	{1: 3}	3 > 1: Pop 1 and map 1 -> 3.
4	[4]	{1: 3, 3: 4}	4 > 3: Pop 3 and map 3 -> 4.
2	[4, 2]	{1: 3, 3: 4}	2 < 4: Push 2.
After traversal, map remaining stack elements to -1:
4 -> -1, 2 -> -1.
Final nge_map: {1: 3, 3: 4, 4: -1, 2: -1}

Step 2: Finding Results for A:

For 4: nge_map[4] = -1.
For 1: nge_map[1] = 3.
For 2: nge_map[2] = -1.
Output: [-1, 3, -1]

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

Preprocessing B: O(m), where m is the size of B. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack once.
Querying A: O(n), where n is the size of A.
Total: O(m + n).
Space Complexity:

Stack: O(m) in the worst case (all elements in B in descending order).
Hash Map: O(m) to store mappings.
Total: O(m).
Edge Cases:
A or B is empty: Return an empty result.
All elements in B are in descending order: All elements map to -1.
A contains duplicates: Each duplicate is treated independently.

Got it! Let's dry run the problem step by step in a narrative format without using a table.

Dry Run
Input:
A = [4, 1, 2]
B = [1, 3, 4, 2]

Step 1: Preprocess B to Build nge_map
Weâ€™ll traverse B and use a stack to track elements that are waiting for their next greater element. The result is stored in a map (nge_map) that maps each element in B to its next greater element.

Initialize:

stack = []
nge_map = {}
Process the first element of B (1):

The stack is empty, so we simply push 1 onto the stack.
stack = [1]
Process the second element of B (3):

Compare 3 with the top of the stack (1). Since 3 > 1, the next greater element for 1 is 3.
Pop 1 from the stack and update nge_map:
nge_map = {1: 3}
Push 3 onto the stack:
stack = [3]
Process the third element of B (4):

Compare 4 with the top of the stack (3). Since 4 > 3, the next greater element for 3 is 4.
Pop 3 from the stack and update nge_map:
nge_map = {1: 3, 3: 4}
Push 4 onto the stack:
stack = [4]
Process the fourth element of B (2):

Compare 2 with the top of the stack (4). Since 2 < 4, thereâ€™s no update for 4.
Push 2 onto the stack:
stack = [4, 2]
After traversing B:

Any elements left in the stack have no next greater element, so map them to -1:
4 -> -1
2 -> -1
Final nge_map = {1: 3, 3: 4, 4: -1, 2: -1}
Step 2: Use nge_map to Find Results for A
Now that we have the next greater elements for all numbers in B, we can look up the result for each element in A using nge_map.

For the first element in A (4):

Look up nge_map[4]:
The next greater element for 4 is -1.
For the second element in A (1):

Look up nge_map[1]:
The next greater element for 1 is 3.
For the third element in A (2):

Look up nge_map[2]:
The next greater element for 2 is -1.
Final Output:
[-1, 3, -1]

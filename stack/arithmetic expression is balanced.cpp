Problem Statement:
We need to check if an arithmetic expression is balanced in terms of its operators, i.e., every operator (+, -, *, /) should appear between two operands (numbers or variables), and there should be no consecutive operators without operands between them. We also need to handle parentheses properly, ensuring that they are balanced and that operators are placed correctly inside them.

For example:

Valid expression: (a+b) * (c-d)
Invalid expression: a++b or a*(b+)
Intuition:
To solve this problem, we can utilize a stack to track the parentheses and operators:

Parentheses: Every opening parenthesis ( should have a matching closing parenthesis ). We can use the stack to track the opening parentheses, and whenever we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop the stack to ensure it matches an opening parenthesis.
Operators: Operators must always be surrounded by valid operands. This means that no two consecutive operators (like ++ or --) should appear in the expression. We can track whether the previous character was an operator or an operand to detect invalid patterns.
Approach:
Traverse the Expression: We will loop through each character in the expression.
Handling Operands: If the character is an operand (a letter or number), it is valid in any position.
Handling Operators: If the character is an operator, check if it is preceded and followed by valid operands. Specifically, it should not appear right after another operator or at the start of the expression.
Handling Parentheses: When encountering a (, push it onto the stack, and when encountering a ), check if there was a corresponding opening parenthesis. Ensure that operators inside parentheses are balanced as well.
Check for Final State: At the end, ensure the stack is empty (no unmatched parentheses), and the expression has valid operator placement.

    bool checkBalanced(string expression) {
        stack<char> s;
        
        // Traverse each character of the expression
        for (int i = 0; i < expression.size(); i++) {
            char ch = expression[i];
            
            // Check for opening parentheses
            if (ch == '(') {
                s.push(ch);
            }
            
            // Check for closing parentheses
            else if (ch == ')') {
                if (s.empty() || s.top() != '(') {
                    return false; // Unmatched parentheses
                }
                s.pop();
            }

            else if (ch == '+' || ch == '-' || ch == '*' || ch == '/') {
                // Check for invalid consecutive operators or operators at start/end
                if (i == 0 || i == expression.size() - 1) {
                    return false; // Operator at the start or end
                }
                if (i > 0 && (expression[i-1] == '+' || expression[i-1] == '-' || expression[i-1] == '*' || expression[i-1] == '/')) {
                    return false; // Consecutive operators
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if all parentheses are matched
        return s.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string expression = "(a+b) * (c-d)";
    if (sol.checkBalanced(expression)) {
        cout << "The expression is balanced." << endl;

Explanation of Code:
Traverse the Expression: We loop through each character in the input string.

For every character, we check if it's an opening parenthesis, a closing parenthesis, or an operator.
Handle Parentheses:

For every (, we push it onto the stack.
For every ), we check if there is a corresponding ( in the stack. If not, it means the expression is unbalanced, so we return false.
Handle Operators:

We check if an operator is at the start or end of the expression, which would make it invalid.
We also check if two consecutive operators appear (e.g., ++, --, etc.), which is also invalid.
Final Check: If, after traversing the entire expression, the stack is empty (meaning all opening parentheses were matched with closing ones), the expression is balanced. Otherwise, it's not.

Dry Run with Example:
Let's take the expression: (a+b) * (c-d)

Step 1: Start with an empty stack.

First character is (: push it onto the stack. Stack = ['('].
Step 2: Next character is a, which is an operand. Nothing needs to be done for operands.

Step 3: Next character is +, which is an operator. The previous character is a (a valid operand), so no issue. Proceed.

Step 4: Next character is b, which is an operand.

Step 5: Next character is ). Pop the ( from the stack. Stack = [].

Step 6: Next character is *, which is an operator. The previous character is ) (a valid operand).

Step 7: Next character is (. Push it onto the stack. Stack = ['('].

Step 8: Next character is c, which is an operand.

Step 9: Next character is -, which is an operator. The previous character is c (a valid operand), so no issue.

Step 10: Next character is d, which is an operand.

Step 11: Next character is ). Pop the ( from the stack. Stack = [].

Final Check: The stack is empty, so the expression is balanced.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the length of the expression. We are processing each character once.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(

O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the length of the expression (for the stack).
Conclusion:
This approach checks for balanced expressions by ensuring that parentheses are properly nested and operators are used correctly. The solution efficiently handles all the conditions using a stack and runs in linear time.

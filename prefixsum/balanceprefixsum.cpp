Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find if there exists a point (index) in the array where the sum of the elements to the left of it equals the sum of the elements to the right of it. This point is known as the balance point of the array.

Intuition
The problem boils down to finding an index where the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.
Prefix sum is helpful here, as it allows us to keep track of the sum of elements up to any index efficiently.
We can maintain a running sum of the left part (left_sum) and compute the sum of the right part of the array using the total sum of the array (total_sum).
If at any index, the left sum equals the right sum, we‚Äôve found the balance point.
Approach
Calculate Total Sum:
First, calculate the sum of the entire array (total_sum). The right sum can be derived by subtracting the left sum and the element at the current index from the total_sum.

Iterate Through the Array:
For each element at index i, compare the sum of the elements to the left (left_sum) and the sum of the elements to the right (right_sum).

Check for Balance:
If the sum of the left part equals the right part at any index, return that index as the balance point.

Update Left and Right Sums:
As we iterate through the array, we update left_sum to include the current element and calculate right_sum using the total_sum.


The Idea Behind right_sum = total_sum - left_sum - arr[i]
We need to find the sum of all the elements to the right of the current element arr[i].

Let's break it down step by step:
Total Sum (total_sum):
This is the sum of all elements in the array. In our example, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], so:

total_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16.
Left Sum (left_sum):
This is the sum of all elements before the current index i.
At the start of the iteration, left_sum is 0 because there are no elements before the first element. As we move through the array, we accumulate the sum of elements before each index.

Right Sum:
The right sum is the sum of all elements after the current index i.

How do we calculate right_sum?
We can calculate the right sum by subtracting the sum of the elements before the current element (left_sum) and the current element itself (arr[i]) from the total_sum.

Formula:
right_sum
=
total_sum
‚àí
left_sum
‚àí
arr
[
ùëñ
]
right_sum=total_sum‚àíleft_sum‚àíarr[i]
Why does this formula work?
total_sum represents the sum of all elements.
By subtracting left_sum, we exclude the sum of elements before index i (i.e., elements to the left of arr[i]).
By subtracting arr[i], we exclude the current element itself.
The result is the sum of all elements after the current index i, which is the right sum.
Example with arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]:
At index i = 0 (arr[0] = 1):
left_sum = 0 (there are no elements before index 0).
total_sum = 16 (sum of all elements).
Using the formula:

right_sum
=
total_sum
‚àí
left_sum
‚àí
arr
[
0
]
=
16
‚àí
0
‚àí
1
=
15
right_sum=total_sum‚àíleft_sum‚àíarr[0]=16‚àí0‚àí1=15
So, the right sum is 15, which is the sum of the elements [2, 3, 4, 6].

At index i = 1 (arr[1] = 2):
left_sum = 1 (sum of elements before index 1, i.e., arr[0] = 1).
total_sum = 16 (sum of all elements).
Using the formula:

right_sum
=
total_sum
‚àí
left_sum
‚àí
arr
[
1
]
=
16
‚àí
1
‚àí
2
=
13
right_sum=total_sum‚àíleft_sum‚àíarr[1]=16‚àí1‚àí2=13
So, the right sum is 13, which is the sum of the elements [3, 4, 6].

Summary of Why the Formula Works:
We want to know the sum of the elements to the right of index i.
total_sum includes everything in the array.
By subtracting left_sum, we remove the sum of elements to the left of i.
By subtracting arr[i], we remove the current element, leaving only the sum of elements after i.

Let's do a detailed dry run for the Balance Point of Prefix Sum problem to clarify the process. We'll walk through the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 6].

Input Array:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]

Initial Setup:
total_sum = 16 (This is the sum of all elements in the array: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16)
left_sum = 0 (Initial sum of elements before the current index, starts as 0)
right_sum = 16 (Initial sum of elements after the current index, starts as total_sum)
Goal:
Find if there is any index i where left_sum equals right_sum.

Step-by-Step Execution:
Iteration 1 (i = 0, arr[0] = 1):
Initial state:

left_sum = 0
right_sum = 16
Update right_sum:
We calculate the sum of the elements after index 0.

right_sum
=
total_sum
‚àí
left_sum
‚àí
arr
[
0
]
=
16
‚àí
0
‚àí
1
=
15
right_sum=total_sum‚àíleft_sum‚àíarr[0]=16‚àí0‚àí1=15
Check balance condition:
Is left_sum equal to right_sum?

0 (left sum) is not equal to 15 (right sum).
Continue to the next index.
Update left_sum:
We now add the current element to the left sum for the next iteration.

left_sum
=
left_sum
+
arr
[
0
]
=
0
+
1
=
1
left_sum=left_sum+arr[0]=0+1=1
Iteration 2 (i = 1, arr[1] = 2):
State before the iteration:

left_sum = 1
right_sum = 15
Update right_sum:

right_sum
=
total_sum
‚àí
left_sum
‚àí
arr
[
1
]
=
16
‚àí
1
‚àí
2
=
13
right_sum=total_sum‚àíleft_sum‚àíarr[1]=16‚àí1‚àí2=13
Check balance condition:
Is left_sum equal to right_sum?

1 (left sum) is not equal to 13 (right sum).
Continue to the next index.
Update left_sum:

left_sum
=
left_sum
+
arr
[
1
]
=
1
+
2
=
3
left_sum=left_sum+arr[1]=1+2=3
Iteration 3 (i = 2, arr[2] = 3):
State before the iteration:

left_sum = 3
right_sum = 13
Update right_sum:

right_sum
=
total_sum
‚àí
left_sum
‚àí
arr
[
2
]
=
16
‚àí
3
‚àí
3
=
10
right_sum=total_sum‚àíleft_sum‚àíarr[2]=16‚àí3‚àí3=10
Check balance condition:
Is left_sum equal to right_sum?

3 (left sum) is not equal to 10 (right sum).
Continue to the next index.
Update left_sum:

left_sum
=
left_sum
+
arr
[
2
]
=
3
+
3
=
6
left_sum=left_sum+arr[2]=3+3=6
Iteration 4 (i = 3, arr[3] = 4):
State before the iteration:

left_sum = 6
right_sum = 10
Update right_sum:

right_sum
=
total_sum
‚àí
left_sum
‚àí
arr
[
3
]
=
16
‚àí
6
‚àí
4
=
6
right_sum=total_sum‚àíleft_sum‚àíarr[3]=16‚àí6‚àí4=6
Check balance condition:
Is left_sum equal to right_sum?

6 (left sum) is equal to 6 (right sum).
Therefore, index 3 is the balance point, and we return the result.
Final Answer:
The balance point is at index 3.

Why This Works:
We are iterating over the array and calculating the sum of elements to the right (right_sum) by subtracting the left_sum (sum of elements before the current index) and the current element (arr[i]) from the total_sum.

When left_sum equals right_sum, we have found the balance point where the sum of the elements to the left equals the sum of the elements to the right of the current index.



#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findBalancePoint(const vector<int>& arr) {
    int total_sum = 0;
    int left_sum = 0;

    // Calculate total sum of the array
    for (int num : arr) {
        total_sum += num;
    }

    // Iterate over the array to find the balance point
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        total_sum -= arr[i];  // Subtract current element from total sum to get the right sum

        if (left_sum == total_sum) {
            return i;  // Return the index if balance point is found
        }

        left_sum += arr[i];  // Update left sum
    }

    return -1;  // Return -1 if no balance point exists
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6};
    int balance_point = findBalancePoint(arr);
    
    if (balance_point != -1) {
        cout << "Balance point found at index: " << balance_point << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No balance point found." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

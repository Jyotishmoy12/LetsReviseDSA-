Problem Statement in Detail
You are given an m x n grid, where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You are also given an integer k, which represents the maximum number of obstacles you can eliminate. Your task is to determine the shortest path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1).

If there is no valid path, return -1.

Constraints:

You can move up, down, left, or right.
You cannot move out of the grid.
If there is no path to the bottom-right corner, return -1.
Intuition: How it is a Graph Problem
This problem can be modeled as a graph where:

Each cell (i, j) in the grid is a node.
There are edges between adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
The edge weight depends on whether the destination cell is an obstacle (1) or not (0).
The goal is to find the shortest path from the source node (0, 0) to the target node (m-1, n-1) with the added constraint of eliminating at most k obstacles. This can be achieved using Breadth-First Search (BFS) while keeping track of the number of obstacles eliminated so far.
Approach to Solve It (Step by Step with Explanation)
Model the Problem:

Treat the grid as a graph.
Each cell (i, j) is a node.
Each move to an adjacent cell is an edge.
Use BFS:

BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
Track three key parameters for each state in BFS:
The current cell (x, y).
The remaining number of obstacles that can be eliminated (k).
The current path length.
Data Structures:

A queue to implement BFS, storing the state (x, y, remaining_k, steps).
A visited array to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same or fewer remaining obstacles.
Algorithm:

Start from (0, 0) with k obstacle eliminations available and a path length of 0.
Explore all 4 possible moves (up, down, left, right).
If a move lands on an obstacle (1), decrement k. If k < 0, skip this move.
If a move reaches the target (m-1, n-1), return the current path length.
Use the visited array to ensure we don’t revisit states that offer no better path.
Edge Case:

If the start or end cell is surrounded by obstacles that exceed k, there’s no valid path.

k = 1
Initialization:
Grid Dimensions: m = 5 (rows), n = 5 (columns).
Queue: We begin with the start point (0, 0) with 1 obstacle elimination available, and the number of steps taken so far is 0. Thus, the queue starts as:
Queue: [(0, 0, 1, 0)]
Visited Array: Initially, all cells are unvisited. We set the starting point as visited with k = 1 remaining obstacle eliminations:
Visited: [[1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]
Dry Run Step-by-Step:
First Iteration:
Current: (x=0, y=0, remaining_k=1, steps=0)
Exploring neighbors: We have 4 possible moves from (0, 0) (up, down, left, right):

Move up: Invalid as it goes out of bounds.
Move down: (1, 0) is an obstacle (grid[1][0] = 1), so we can eliminate one obstacle (remaining_k = 0). It’s a valid move, and we push (1, 0, 0, 1) into the queue with 1 step taken.
Move left: Invalid as it goes out of bounds.
Move right: (0, 1) is an empty space (grid[0][1] = 0), so remaining_k remains 1. It’s a valid move, and we push (0, 1, 1, 1) into the queue with 1 step taken.
Queue after the first iteration: [(1, 0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1, 1)]

Visited array: [[1, 1, -1, -1, -1], [0, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]

Second Iteration:
Current: (x=1, y=0, remaining_k=0, steps=1)
Exploring neighbors: We have 4 possible moves from (1, 0):

Move up: (0, 0) is already visited with the same or fewer remaining eliminations, so we don’t revisit.
Move down: (2, 0) is an empty space (grid[2][0] = 0), so remaining_k remains 0. It’s a valid move, and we push (2, 0, 0, 2) into the queue with 2 steps taken.
Move left: Invalid as it goes out of bounds.
Move right: (1, 1) is an obstacle (grid[1][1] = 1), but since remaining_k = 0, we can't eliminate this obstacle. So, we skip this move.
Queue after the second iteration: [(0, 1, 1, 1), (2, 0, 0, 2)]

Visited array: [[1, 1, -1, -1, -1], [0, -1, -1, -1, -1], [0, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]

Third Iteration:
Current: (x=0, y=1, remaining_k=1, steps=1)
Exploring neighbors: We have 4 possible moves from (0, 1):

Move up: Invalid as it goes out of bounds.
Move down: (1, 1) is an obstacle (grid[1][1] = 1), but since remaining_k = 1, we can eliminate it. We move to (1, 1) with remaining_k = 0 and push (1, 1, 0, 2) into the queue with 2 steps taken.
Move left: (0, 0) is already visited, so we skip this move.
Move right: (0, 2) is an empty space (grid[0][2] = 0), so remaining_k remains 1. We move to (0, 2) and push (0, 2, 1, 2) into the queue with 2 steps taken.
Queue after the third iteration: [(2, 0, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0, 2), (0, 2, 1, 2)]

Visited array: [[1, 1, 1, -1, -1], [0, 0, -1, -1, -1], [0, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]

Fourth Iteration:
Current: (x=2, y=0, remaining_k=0, steps=2)
Exploring neighbors: We have 4 possible moves from (2, 0):

Move up: (1, 0) is already visited with remaining_k = 0, so we skip this move.
Move down: (3, 0) is an obstacle (grid[3][0] = 1), but since remaining_k = 0, we can’t eliminate this obstacle, so we skip this move.
Move left: Invalid as it goes out of bounds.
Move right: (2, 1) is an empty space (grid[2][1] = 0), so remaining_k remains 0. We move to (2, 1) and push (2, 1, 0, 3) into the queue with 3 steps taken.
Queue after the fourth iteration: [(1, 1, 0, 2), (0, 2, 1, 2), (2, 1, 0, 3)]

Visited array: [[1, 1, 1, -1, -1], [0, 0, -1, -1, -1], [0, 0, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]

Continuing the Process:
This process continues where we keep exploring all possible moves from the current position. We eventually reach the destination (4, 4) after 8 steps, or we return -1 if there’s no valid path.

Key Observations:
The BFS ensures that we explore the shortest path first because of the way nodes are added to the queue.
The visited array keeps track of the remaining number of obstacles that can still be eliminated, preventing revisiting states that wouldn’t offer a better path.

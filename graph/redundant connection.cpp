Problem Statement in Detail:
In an undirected graph, we are given a list of edges, and we need to identify a redundant connection. A redundant connection is an edge that, if removed, would still leave the graph as a valid tree (i.e., no cycles and all nodes remain connected). In this problem, we need to return the edge that forms a cycle when added to the graph.

Given:

A graph is represented by an edge list, where each edge is a pair of integers representing a connection between two nodes.
The graph is initially a tree with n nodes, but one extra edge is added, which causes a cycle.
Objective:

Find and return the redundant edge that, when removed, would leave the graph as a tree again.
Example 1:

Input:

lua
Copy
Edit
edges = [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[2,3]
Explanation:

Initially, the graph has edges [1, 2] and [1, 3], which forms a tree with no cycle.
When the edge [2, 3] is added, it forms a cycle. Hence, the redundant edge is [2, 3].
Example 2:

Input:

css
Copy
Edit
edges = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[1,4]
Explanation:

Initially, the graph has edges [1, 2], [2, 3], and [3, 4], which form a tree.
When the edge [1, 4] is added, it forms a cycle. Hence, the redundant edge is [1, 4].
Intuition Behind the Problem:
The problem is about detecting cycles in an undirected graph. If an edge causes a cycle, it is the redundant edge.
This is a graph problem because we are dealing with the connectivity between nodes, and we need to determine whether adding an edge will introduce a cycle.
We can use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to efficiently detect cycles in the graph.
Approach to Solve It Step-by-Step:
Union-Find Data Structure:

Union-Find helps efficiently manage the connected components of a graph. It supports two operations:
Find: Determines the root of a set that an element belongs to.
Union: Merges two sets into one.
When we process an edge, we use Find to check if both endpoints are in the same set. If they are, adding the edge would create a cycle.
If they are in different sets, we perform a Union operation to merge the sets.
Iterate through the edges:

For each edge, use the Find operation to check if both nodes are already in the same connected component.
If they are, then this edge forms a cycle, and we return it as the redundant edge.
If not, we perform the Union operation to connect the nodes.
Return the Redundant Edge:

The first edge that forms a cycle is the redundant edge, and we return it.

    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);

            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }
    }

        int u = edge[0];
        int v = edge[1];
        
        // If u and v are already connected, we found the redundant edge
        if (uf.find(u) == uf.find(v)) {
            return edge;
        }
        
        // Otherwise, unite the two components
        uf.unite(u, v);
    }
    
    return {};

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> edges1 = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}};
    vector<vector<int>> edges2 = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}};
    
    vector<int> result1 = findRedundantConnection(edges1);
    vector<int> result2 = findRedundantConnection(edges2);
    
    cout << "Redundant edge in edges1: [" << result1[0] << ", " << result1[1] << "]" << endl;
    cout << "Redundant edge in edges2: [" << result2[0] << ", " << result2[1] << "]" << endl;

    return 0;

Explanation Line-by-Line:
Union-Find Class:

UnionFind(int n) initializes the parent array to represent n nodes. Initially, each node is its own parent (i.e., each node is its own disjoint set).
find(int x) recursively finds the root of the set containing x (with path compression for efficiency).
unite(int x, int y) merges the sets containing x and y by setting the root of one set to be the root of the other.
findRedundantConnection Function:

We create a UnionFind object with edges.size() + 1 nodes (since nodes are 1-indexed).
We iterate through each edge in the edges list:
For each edge, we check if the two nodes are already connected using the find operation.
If they are connected, this edge would create a cycle, and we return it as the redundant edge.
If they are not connected, we unite the two sets using the unite operation.
Main Function:

We test the function with two example edge lists (edges1 and edges2).
The output shows the redundant edges for each input graph.
Dry Run:
Input:

lua
Copy
Edit
edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
Initialize Union-Find:

parent = [0, 1, 2, 3] (nodes 1, 2, 3 are initially their own parents).
Process Edge [1, 2]:

find(1) != find(2), so no cycle.
Perform union(1, 2), update parent = [0, 2, 2, 3].
Process Edge [1, 3]:

find(1) != find(3), so no cycle.
Perform union(1, 3), update parent = [0, 2, 2, 2].
Process Edge [2, 3]:

find(2) == find(3), so a cycle is detected.
Return [2, 3] as the redundant edge.
Output:

Redundant edge in edges1: [2, 3]
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

The find and unite operations are nearly constant time, due to path compression and union by rank. Each operation is O(α(n)), where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly and is almost constant for practical values of n.
Thus, the time complexity is O(E * α(V)), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity:

We use an array to store the parent of each node, which requires O(V) space, where V is the number of nodes.
Therefore, the space complexity is O(V).
Conclusion:
This approach efficiently detects the redundant edge that creates a cycle in an undirected graph, using the Union-Find data structure with path compression and union by rank for optimal performance.

Problem Statement:
You are given two strings s1 and s2, and a set of operations. The goal is to determine if it is possible to transform s1 into s2 by applying the given operations.

The operations are defined as:

Swap: You can swap any two characters in the string.
Reverse: You can reverse the string.
You need to determine if you can transform s1 into s2 using any combination of the above operations.

Intuition on how it is a Graph Problem:
This problem can be modeled as a graph problem where each string represents a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if one string can be transformed into another string by applying one operation (either swap or reverse). We can then use a BFS or DFS approach to explore the transformation possibilities.

The transformation rules (swap and reverse) indicate that there are possible transitions between the nodes (strings), and we can traverse these transitions to find if there exists a path between s1 and s2.

Approach to Solve it Step-by-Step:
Initial Check:

If s1 and s2 have different lengths, it is impossible to transform s1 into s2. Return false immediately.
Check Frequency of Characters:

Both strings s1 and s2 must have the same frequency of characters to be able to transform one into the other. If they don't, return false.
Graph Representation:

Consider each string as a node in the graph. Two nodes (strings) are connected if you can perform one operation to transform one string into another.
We will use BFS or DFS to explore all the strings reachable from s1 and check if s2 is reachable.
Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS):

Start with s1, and at each step, generate all possible transformations of the current string by applying the operations (swap and reverse).
Add these transformed strings to the queue (for BFS) or stack (for DFS).
Mark each visited string to avoid revisiting and infinite loops.
If you reach s2, return true; otherwise, continue exploring.
Final Check:

If you exhaust all possibilities without reaching s2, return false.

using namespace std;

bool canTransform(string s1, string s2) {
    // Step 1: If the lengths of s1 and s2 are different, return false
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
        return false;
    }

    // Step 2: Check if both strings have the same frequency of characters
    sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
    sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());
    if (s1 != s2) {
        return false;
    }

    // Step 3: BFS to explore all possible transformations
    queue<string> q;
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    
    q.push(s1);
    visited.insert(s1);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        string current = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // If we reached the destination string
        if (current == s2) {
            return true;
        }

        // Step 4: Generate all possible transformations from current string
        // 1. Swap: Generate all strings by swapping any two characters
        for (int i = 0; i < current.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < current.length(); j++) {
                string swapped = current;
                swap(swapped[i], swapped[j]);
                if (visited.find(swapped) == visited.end()) {
                    visited.insert(swapped);
                    q.push(swapped);
                }
            }
        }

        // 2. Reverse: Generate the reversed string
        string reversed = current;
        reverse(reversed.begin(), reversed.end());
        if (visited.find(reversed) == visited.end()) {
            visited.insert(reversed);
            q.push(reversed);
        }
    }

    // If we exhaust all possibilities without finding s2
    return false;
}

int main() {
    string s1 = "abc";
    string s2 = "cba";

    if (canTransform(s1, s2)) {
        cout << "Yes, transformation is possible." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No, transformation is not possible." << endl;
    }

    return 0;

Dry Run:
Input:
s1 = "abc"
s2 = "cba"
Step 1: Initial Check:
s1 and s2 have the same length (3), so we proceed.
Step 2: Check Frequency of Characters:
Sorting s1 = "abc" results in "abc".
Sorting s2 = "cba" results in "abc".
Since the sorted strings are the same, we can proceed.
Step 3: BFS Initialization:
Queue: ["abc"]
Visited: {"abc"}
Step 4: BFS Process:
Current string = "abc":

Generate swapped strings:
Swap positions 0 and 1 → "bac" (Not visited, add to queue)
Swap positions 0 and 2 → "cba" (Not visited, add to queue)
Swap positions 1 and 2 → "acb" (Not visited, add to queue)
Generate reversed string: "cba" (Already added, no need to add again)
Queue after processing "abc": ["bac", "cba", "acb"]

Current string = "bac":

Generate swapped strings:
Swap positions 0 and 1 → "abc" (Already visited, skip)
Swap positions 0 and 2 → "cab" (Not visited, add to queue)
Swap positions 1 and 2 → "bca" (Not visited, add to queue)
Generate reversed string: "cab" (Already added, no need to add again)
Queue after processing "bac": ["cba", "acb", "cab", "bca"]

Current string = "cba":

Found that "cba" matches s2, so we return true.
Step 5: Return Result:
Since we found a transformation path from s1 to s2, we return true.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:
Sorting the strings s1 and s2 takes O(n log n) where n is the length of the strings.
BFS takes O(V + E) where V is the number of nodes (possible string configurations) and E is the number of edges (possible transformations between strings). In the worst case, we generate all permutations of the string, which gives us a time complexity of O(n! + n^2) due to swaps and reversals.
Space Complexity:
Space complexity is dominated by the storage needed for the visited set and the queue, which in the worst case can store all n! possible string configurations. Therefore, space complexity is O(n!).

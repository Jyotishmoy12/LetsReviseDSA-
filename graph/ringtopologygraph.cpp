Problem Statement in Detail
You are given a set of nodes representing computers in a network. These nodes are connected in a ring topology, meaning:

Each node is connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a closed loop.
The goal is to verify if the given network graph forms a valid ring topology.
Input and Output Example
Input:

makefile
Copy
Edit
n = 4
edges = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 1}}
Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
true
Explanation: The graph forms a closed loop: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

Input:

makefile
Copy
Edit
n = 4
edges = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}}
Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
false
Explanation: The graph is not a closed loop since node 4 is not connected back to node 1.

Intuition - How It Is a Graph Problem
Nodes and Edges:
Each computer is represented as a node.
Connections between computers are edges.
Graph Properties:
A valid ring topology has exactly n nodes and n edges.
Each node has exactly 2 neighbors.
The graph is a single connected component (all nodes are reachable).
Approach to Solve
To determine if the given graph is a ring topology:

Validate Edge Count: Ensure the number of edges is equal to n.
Validate Degree of Nodes: Check that every node has exactly 2 connections.
Connectivity Check: Use BFS or DFS to confirm all nodes are part of one connected component.

Code Explanation Line by Line
Edge Count Validation:

cpp
Copy
Edit
if (edges.size() != n) return false;
A valid ring must have exactly n edges.
Build Adjacency List:

cpp
Copy
Edit
unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adj;
for (auto edge : edges) {
    adj[edge.first].push_back(edge.second);
    adj[edge.second].push_back(edge.first);
}
Construct a graph representation where adj[node] lists its neighbors.
Degree Check:

cpp
Copy
Edit
for (auto &[node, neighbors] : adj) {
    if (neighbors.size() != 2) return false;
}
Verify that every node is connected to exactly two other nodes.
Connectivity Check with BFS:

cpp
Copy
Edit
unordered_set<int> visited;
queue<int> q;
q.push(1); // Start from any node
visited.insert(1);
Use BFS to traverse the graph and ensure all nodes are connected.
Final Check:

cpp
Copy
Edit
return visited.size() == n;
Confirm that all nodes have been visited, ensuring a single connected component.
Dry Run
Input:

makefile
Copy
Edit
n = 4
edges = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 1}}
Step 1: Edge Count Validation

edges.size() = 4, matches n = 4. Proceed.
Step 2: Build Adjacency List

yaml
Copy
Edit
adj = {
    1: [2, 4],
    2: [1, 3],
    3: [2, 4],
    4: [3, 1]
}
Step 3: Degree Check

Node 1 has 2 neighbors: [2, 4].
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: [1, 3].
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: [2, 4].
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: [3, 1].
All nodes have degree 2. Proceed.
Step 4: Connectivity Check

BFS starts from node 1.
Visited nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Step 5: Final Check

visited.size() = n = 4.
Graph is connected and valid.
Output: true

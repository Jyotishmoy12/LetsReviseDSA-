Problem Statement in Detail:
Stone Game Graph

Input:

A graph is represented as a 2D matrix G where G[i][j] = 1 means there's an edge between node i and node j, and G[i][j] = 0 means there's no edge between node i and node j.
You are given an integer k, representing the number of stones to be placed on the graph.
Output:

The output is the number of possible ways to place k stones on the graph such that no two stones share the same connected component.

2
Explanation:

In this example, the graph consists of two connected components: one with nodes 0 and 1, and the other with node 2. We want to place 2 stones in such a way that no two stones are placed in the same connected component.
The two valid placements are:
Place one stone on node 0, and another stone on node 2.
Place one stone on node 1, and another stone on node 2.
Example 2:

Input:

Explanation:

In this case, we can place one stone in any of the three nodes 0, 1, or 2, as there are no restrictions on the number of stones to be placed in the same connected component.
Intuition: How It Is a Graph Problem
This problem is a graph problem because it revolves around identifying connected components in an undirected graph and placing stones on the graph's nodes. The challenge is to ensure that no two stones are placed within the same connected component. Thus, we need to find the connected components and ensure the placement of k stones in distinct components.

Approach to Solve It in Detail, Step-by-Step with Proper Explanation
Find the Connected Components:

We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to identify all the connected components in the graph.
We traverse the graph starting from each unvisited node, marking all reachable nodes as part of the same component.
Count the Number of Components:

After identifying all connected components, count the total number of components in the graph.
Choose k Components:

From the identified components, we need to select k components for placing stones. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the number of components.
Place Stones in the Chosen Components:

Once k components are chosen, we can place one stone in each of the chosen components. The number of ways to do this is simply k! (factorial of k), as we can permute the stones in the selected components.

        if (G[node][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
            dfs(i, G, visited);

    int n = G.size();

    // Step 2: If there are less than k components, return 0 as it's not possible

Code Explanation Line by Line in Detail:
#include <iostream> – Includes the input-output stream library for printing results.
#include <vector> – Includes the vector library to store the graph and visited nodes.
#include <algorithm> – Includes the algorithm library for utility functions like sort.
void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& G, vector<bool>& visited) – Defines the DFS function to traverse the graph.
Marks the node as visited and recursively visits all its adjacent nodes.
int stoneGameGraph(vector<vector<int>>& G, int k) – Defines the main function to solve the problem.
Initializes the number of nodes n, visited array, and a counter for connected components.
dfs(i, G, visited); – Calls DFS to explore all nodes in the current component.
if (componentCount < k) return 0; – Returns 0 if there are fewer than k components, meaning it's impossible to place the stones.
long long result = 1; – Initializes the result variable.
for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) { result *= (componentCount - i); } – Calculates the number of ways to choose k components from the total components.
for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { result *= i; } – Multiplies by k! to permute the stones in the chosen components.
return result; – Returns the total number of valid placements for the stones.
Dry Run with the Code Step by Step:
Input:
G = {{0, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0}}
k = 2
Step 1:
DFS starts from node 0, marking nodes 0 and 1 as part of one connected component.
DFS continues from node 2, marking node 2 as part of another connected component.
Step 2:
Total number of connected components = 2.
Step 3:
Since k = 2, we can select all 2 components, so the number of ways to choose 2 components is C(2, 2) = 1.
Step 4:
Multiply by 2! = 2 to permute the stones.
Output:
The total number of valid ways to place the stones is 2.
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

O(n^2): The DFS takes O(n^2) due to the adjacency matrix traversal, where n is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity:

O(n^2): The graph is stored as an adjacency matrix, which requires O(n^2) space.

Problem Statement in Detail:
Given an undirected graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of edges, determine if the graph is a valid tree.

A graph is a tree if:

It is connected (there's a path between any two nodes).
It has no cycles (adding any edge would create a cycle).
Given:

An integer n representing the number of nodes in the graph.
A 2D array edges, where each element edges[i] = [u, v] represents an edge between nodes u and v.
Objective:

Return true if the graph is a valid tree, otherwise return false.

Explanation:

The graph is connected, and there are no cycles. Hence, it is a valid tree.

false
Explanation:

The graph has a cycle (1-2-3-1), so it is not a valid tree.
Intuition Behind the Problem:
Connected: For a graph to be connected, there should be a path between every pair of nodes. If we start from any node, we should be able to visit all other nodes by traversing the edges.

No Cycles: If there is a cycle in the graph, it cannot be a tree. A cycle occurs when there is more than one path to reach a node, which violates the tree property of having exactly one path between any two nodes.

A valid tree with n nodes must have exactly n-1 edges. This is because a tree is minimally connected. If we add any more edges, it will introduce a cycle.

Approach to Solve It Step-by-Step:
Edge Count: A valid tree with n nodes must have exactly n-1 edges. If the number of edges is not n-1, return false immediately.

Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union):

We use Union-Find to detect cycles in the graph. This will allow us to group connected nodes and check if adding an edge creates a cycle.
We maintain a parent array to track the root of each node and a rank array to manage the merging of sets.
Graph Traversal:

Traverse all the edges. For each edge, check if the two nodes are already connected by using the find operation. If they are connected, it means adding this edge would form a cycle, and we return false.
Otherwise, we unite the two components using the union operation.
Final Check: After processing all edges, we need to check if all nodes are connected. This can be done by ensuring that all nodes have the same root (i.e., they belong to the same connected component).

Explanation Line-by-Line:
Union-Find Class:

UnionFind(int n) initializes the parent array, where each node is initially its own parent, and the rank array to manage the merging of sets.
find(int x) recursively finds the root of the set containing x. Path compression is used for optimization.
unite(int x, int y) merges the sets containing x and y by rank to ensure balanced tree structures.
validTree Function:

First, check if the number of edges is n - 1. If not, return false immediately.
Initialize the UnionFind structure for n nodes.
Iterate through each edge and perform the following:
Use the find operation to check if the two nodes are already connected. If they are, it means adding this edge would form a cycle, so return false.
Otherwise, use the unite operation to merge the sets containing the two nodes.
Main Function:

Test the function with two example graphs, edges1 and edges2.
Print the results for each graph.
Dry Run:
Input:

lua
Copy
Edit
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
n = 5
Check Edge Count:

The number of edges is 4, and n - 1 = 4. So, proceed.
Initialize Union-Find:

parent = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], rank = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
Process Edge [0, 1]:

find(0) != find(1), so no cycle.
Perform unite(0, 1), update parent = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4].
Process Edge [0, 2]:

find(0) != find(2), so no cycle.
Perform unite(0, 2), update parent = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4].
Process Edge [0, 3]:

find(0) != find(3), so no cycle.
Perform unite(0, 3), update parent = [2, 2, 2, 2, 4].
Process Edge [1, 4]:

find(1) != find(4), so no cycle.
Perform unite(1, 4), update parent = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2].
Return True:

All nodes are connected, and there are no cycles.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

The find and unite operations are nearly constant time, due to path compression and union by rank. Each operation is O(α(n)), where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly and is almost constant for practical values of n.
Thus, the time complexity is O(E * α(V)), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity:

We use two arrays (parent and rank), each of size V. Therefore, the space complexity is O(V).

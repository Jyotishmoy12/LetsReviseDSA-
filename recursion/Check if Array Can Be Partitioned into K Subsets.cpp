Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, determine whether the array can be partitioned into k subsets such that the sum of elements in each subset is equal.

Intuition:
This problem requires distributing the elements of the array into k subsets where each subset has the same sum. This can be reduced to finding subsets that add up to 
target
=
sum(nums)
𝑘
target= 
k
sum(nums)
​
 . If the total sum is not divisible by 
𝑘
k, it's impossible to partition.

By leveraging a priority queue (max-heap), we can try to fill the largest subset first, ensuring that the bigger elements are used before smaller ones. This approach reduces backtracking and speeds up computation.

Approach:
Initial Validation:

Check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 
𝑘
k. If not, return false.
If any element in the array is greater than the target sum (
target
=
sum(nums)
𝑘
target= 
k
sum(nums)
​
 ), return false.
Use Priority Queue (Max-Heap):

Sort the array in descending order (or use a max-heap).
Initialize a list of k subsets, all starting with a sum of 0.
Use backtracking to try to distribute elements into subsets.
Backtracking with Priority Queue:

Try to place the largest number into a subset that doesn’t exceed the target sum.
Use recursion to explore all possible distributions.
Return the Result:

If all elements can be distributed such that each subset has the same sum, return true. Otherwise, return false.

        // If total sum is not divisible by k, partitioning is impossible
        if (totalSum % k != 0) return false;

        int target = totalSum / k;
        sort(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend()); // Sort in descending order

        // If the largest number is greater than the target, return false

Let's go step-by-step through a detailed dry run of the canPartitionKSubsets function for the input:
nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1]
and k = 4.

Step-by-Step Execution:
Initial Setup:
nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1]
k = 4
Step 1: Calculate totalSum and target:
cpp
Copy
Edit
int totalSum = 0;
for (int num : nums) totalSum += num;
// totalSum = 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 20
totalSum = 20
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (totalSum % k != 0) return false;
int target = totalSum / k;
// target = 20 / 4 = 5
target = 5
Step 2: Sort nums in descending order:
cpp
Copy
Edit
sort(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend());
// nums = [5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]
Step 3: Initialize subsets:
cpp
Copy
Edit
vector<int> subsets(k, 0);
// subsets = [0, 0, 0, 0]
We initialize k subsets with 0 sum initially.
Calling the backtracking function: backtrack(nums, subsets, 0, target):
We start the recursion with the first number in the sorted nums array.

First Call to backtrack:
index = 0, current nums[index] = 5, current subsets = [0, 0, 0, 0]

Iteration 1: Try adding 5 to subset 0:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[0] + nums[0] <= target) {
    subsets[0] += nums[0];  // subsets[0] = 5
    if (backtrack(nums, subsets, 1, target)) return true;
    subsets[0] -= nums[0];  // subsets[0] = 0
}
Subsets after adding 5: [5, 0, 0, 0]
Now, we recursively call backtrack with index = 1.
Second Call to backtrack:
index = 1, current nums[index] = 4, current subsets = [5, 0, 0, 0]

Iteration 1: Try adding 4 to subset 0:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[0] + nums[1] <= target) {
    subsets[0] += nums[1];  // subsets[0] = 9 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[0] -= nums[1];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 4 to subset 0 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 2: Try adding 4 to subset 1:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[1] + nums[1] <= target) {
    subsets[1] += nums[1];  // subsets[1] = 4
    if (backtrack(nums, subsets, 2, target)) return true;
    subsets[1] -= nums[1];  // subsets[1] = 0
}
Subsets after adding 4: [5, 4, 0, 0]
Now, we recursively call backtrack with index = 2.
Third Call to backtrack:
index = 2, current nums[index] = 3, current subsets = [5, 4, 0, 0]

Iteration 1: Try adding 3 to subset 0:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[0] + nums[2] <= target) {
    subsets[0] += nums[2];  // subsets[0] = 8 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[0] -= nums[2];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 3 to subset 0 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 2: Try adding 3 to subset 1:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[1] + nums[2] <= target) {
    subsets[1] += nums[2];  // subsets[1] = 7 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[1] -= nums[2];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 3 to subset 1 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 3: Try adding 3 to subset 2:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[2] + nums[2] <= target) {
    subsets[2] += nums[2];  // subsets[2] = 3
    if (backtrack(nums, subsets, 3, target)) return true;
    subsets[2] -= nums[2];  // subsets[2] = 0
}
Subsets after adding 3: [5, 4, 3, 0]
Now, we recursively call backtrack with index = 3.
Fourth Call to backtrack:
index = 3, current nums[index] = 3, current subsets = [5, 4, 3, 0]

Iteration 1: Try adding 3 to subset 0:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[0] + nums[3] <= target) {
    subsets[0] += nums[3];  // subsets[0] = 8 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[0] -= nums[3];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 3 to subset 0 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 2: Try adding 3 to subset 1:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[1] + nums[3] <= target) {
    subsets[1] += nums[3];  // subsets[1] = 7 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[1] -= nums[3];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 3 to subset 1 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 3: Try adding 3 to subset 2:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[2] + nums[3] <= target) {
    subsets[2] += nums[3];  // subsets[2] = 6 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[2] -= nums[3];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 3 to subset 2 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 4: Try adding 3 to subset 3:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[3] + nums[3] <= target) {
    subsets[3] += nums[3];  // subsets[3] = 3
    if (backtrack(nums, subsets, 4, target)) return true;
    subsets[3] -= nums[3];  // subsets[3] = 0
}
Subsets after adding 3: [5, 4, 3, 3]
Now, we recursively call backtrack with index = 4.
Fifth Call to backtrack:
index = 4, current nums[index] = 2, current subsets = [5, 4, 3, 3]

Iteration 1: Try adding 2 to subset 0:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[0] + nums[4] <= target) {
    subsets[0] += nums[4];  // subsets[0] = 7 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[0] -= nums[4];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 2 to subset 0 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 2: Try adding 2 to subset 1:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[1] + nums[4] <= target) {
    subsets[1] += nums[4];  // subsets[1] = 6 (not valid as it exceeds target)
    subsets[1] -= nums[4];  // backtrack
}
We can't add 2 to subset 1 as it exceeds the target.
Iteration 3: Try adding 2 to subset 2:
cpp
Copy
Edit
if (subsets[2] + nums[4] <= target) {
    subsets[2] += nums[4];  // subsets[2] = 5
    if (backtrack(nums, subsets, 5, target)) return true;
    subsets[2] -= nums[4];  // subsets[2] = 3
}
Subsets after adding 2: [5, 4, 5, 3]
Now, we recursively call backtrack with index = 5.
Continuing similarly, we can successfully place the remaining elements into the subsets and conclude the partitioning is possible.
Final Result:
The backtracking function will return true once all elements are successfully distributed among the k subsets, all having the same sum.

Problem Statement:
Given the inorder and level-order traversals of a binary tree, you are to determine the bottom view of the binary tree. The bottom view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the bottom.

Intuition:
For each node, assign a horizontal distance (HD). The root node has an HD of 0, and for every left child, the HD is decremented by 1, while for every right child, the HD is incremented by 1.
For each HD, we maintain the last node encountered at that particular HD. This ensures that we capture the bottom-most node for every vertical column.
As we traverse the tree in level order, we continue updating the node for each HD to ensure we get the bottom-most node.
Approach:
Initialization:

Use a queue to traverse the tree in level-order (BFS).
For each node, also store its corresponding horizontal distance (HD).
Traversal:

Start with the root node, set its HD = 0.
Traverse each node level-by-level, and update the map for each HD with the nodeâ€™s data. Since we want the bottom view, we will always update the node data if a node exists at the same HD.
Final Result:

Once the tree is fully traversed, the map will contain the bottom-most nodes at each horizontal distance. Extract the values from the map in order of increasing HD.
Dry Run Example:
Consider the following binary tree:

markdown
Copy code
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \   \
      4   5   6
         /     \
        7       8
Level Order Traversal:

Copy code
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Inorder Traversal:

Copy code
4, 2, 5, 1, 7, 3, 6, 8
We can perform the following steps:

Start with the root (1) at HD = 0.
Traverse left to node (2) at HD = -1, and right to node (3) at HD = +1.
Continue for the rest of the nodes, updating the map to capture the bottom-most node at each HD.
The final horizontal distances and corresponding nodes are:

HD = -2: Node 4
HD = -1: Node 5
HD = 0: Node 7 (since 1 was already overwritten by 7)
HD = +1: Node 8 (since 3 was already overwritten by 8)
Bottom View: 4, 5, 7, 8

Code (C++):
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

vector<int> bottomView(Node* root) {
    // Map to store the last node's data at each horizontal distance
    unordered_map<int, int> bottomNodes;
    
    // Queue to perform level order traversal (BFS)
    queue<pair<Node*, int>> q;
    // Start with the root node at HD = 0
    q.push({root, 0});
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        pair<Node*, int> front = q.front();
        Node* node = front.first;
        int hd = front.second;
        q.pop();
        
        // Update the map with the node's data for this horizontal distance
        bottomNodes[hd] = node->data;
        
        // Enqueue left and right children if they exist
        if (node->left) q.push({node->left, hd - 1});
        if (node->right) q.push({node->right, hd + 1});
    }
    
    // Extract the bottom view from the map
    vector<int> result;
    for (auto& pair : bottomNodes) {
        result.push_back(pair.second);
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->left = new Node(2);
    root->right = new Node(3);
    root->left->left = new Node(4);
    root->left->right = new Node(5);
    root->right->right = new Node(6);
    root->left->right->left = new Node(7);
    root->right->right->right = new Node(8);
    
    vector<int> result = bottomView(root);
    for (int val : result) {
        cout << val << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity:

O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
We visit every node exactly once in the level-order traversal.
For each node, we perform constant time operations to update the map and enqueue its children.
Space Complexity:

O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
We store each node in the queue and also maintain an unordered map for the horizontal distances.
This is the optimal solution for finding the bottom view of a binary tree.

Let's go step by step for a clearer dry run of the Bottom View of a binary tree. Here's the dry run for the following binary tree:

markdown
Copy code
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \   \
      4   5   6
         /     \
        7       8
Step-by-step Dry Run:
Initialization:

The queue holds pairs of nodes and their horizontal distances (HD).
The unordered map (bottomNodes) will hold the last node's data for each horizontal distance.
We start by pushing the root node 1 with horizontal distance 0 into the queue:

makefile
Copy code
queue: [(1, 0)]
bottomNodes: {}
First iteration:

Dequeue node 1 (HD = 0).
Update the map: bottomNodes[0] = 1.
Enqueue the left child 2 (HD = -1) and the right child 3 (HD = +1).
yaml
Copy code
queue: [(2, -1), (3, 1)]
bottomNodes: {0: 1}
Second iteration:

Dequeue node 2 (HD = -1).
Update the map: bottomNodes[-1] = 2 (since 2 is the first node at HD = -1).
Enqueue the left child 4 (HD = -2) and the right child 5 (HD = 0).
yaml
Copy code
queue: [(3, 1), (4, -2), (5, 0)]
bottomNodes: {0: 1, -1: 2}
Third iteration:

Dequeue node 3 (HD = +1).
Update the map: bottomNodes[1] = 3 (since 3 is the first node at HD = +1).
Enqueue the right child 6 (HD = +2).
yaml
Copy code
queue: [(4, -2), (5, 0), (6, 2)]
bottomNodes: {0: 1, -1: 2, 1: 3}
Fourth iteration:

Dequeue node 4 (HD = -2).
Update the map: bottomNodes[-2] = 4 (since 4 is the first node at HD = -2).
No children to enqueue for node 4.
yaml
Copy code
queue: [(5, 0), (6, 2)]
bottomNodes: {0: 1, -1: 2, 1: 3, -2: 4}
Fifth iteration:

Dequeue node 5 (HD = 0).
Update the map: bottomNodes[0] = 5 (since we are overwriting the previous entry at HD = 0, we take the bottom-most node).
Enqueue the left child 7 (HD = -1).
yaml
Copy code
queue: [(6, 2), (7, -1)]
bottomNodes: {0: 5, -1: 2, 1: 3, -2: 4}
Sixth iteration:

Dequeue node 6 (HD = +2).
Update the map: bottomNodes[2] = 6 (since 6 is the first node at HD = +2).
Enqueue the right child 8 (HD = +3).
yaml
Copy code
queue: [(7, -1), (8, 3)]
bottomNodes: {0: 5, -1: 2, 1: 3, -2: 4, 2: 6}
Seventh iteration:

Dequeue node 7 (HD = -1).
Update the map: bottomNodes[-1] = 7 (since we are overwriting the previous entry at HD = -1, we take the bottom-most node).
No children to enqueue for node 7.
yaml
Copy code
queue: [(8, 3)]
bottomNodes: {0: 5, -1: 7, 1: 3, -2: 4, 2: 6}
Eighth iteration:

Dequeue node 8 (HD = +3).
Update the map: bottomNodes[3] = 8 (since 8 is the first node at HD = +3).
No children to enqueue for node 8.
yaml
Copy code
queue: []
bottomNodes: {0: 5, -1: 7, 1: 3, -2: 4, 2: 6, 3: 8}
Final Step:
After the level-order traversal completes, the map bottomNodes holds the bottom-most nodes for each horizontal distance:

yaml
Copy code
bottomNodes = {0: 5, -1: 7, 1: 3, -2: 4, 2: 6, 3: 8}
Extracting the Bottom View:
To get the bottom view of the binary tree, we need to extract the values in increasing order of horizontal distance (HD):

HD = -2: 4
HD = -1: 7
HD = 0: 5
HD = 1: 3
HD = 2: 6
HD = 3: 8
Thus, the bottom view is:

Copy code
4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8
Explanation of Formula (+1, -1):
The formula HD - 1 for the left child and HD + 1 for the right child works because the left child of any node is one level deeper in the negative direction (left), and the right child is one level deeper in the positive direction (right).
Summary of the Process:
Start from the root and traverse the tree level by level.
Keep track of the horizontal distance (HD) for each node using the queue.
Update the map at each HD to store the last node at that horizontal distance, ensuring that we capture the bottom-most node at each level.
After the traversal is complete, sort the horizontal distances and extract the corresponding node values to get the bottom view.

Problem Description
Given a binary tree, a target node, and an integer 
ùêæ
K, you need to find the 
ùêæ
K-th ancestor of the given node. An ancestor of a node is any node that lies on the path from the root to that node. The root is considered the top-most ancestor.

Constraints:
If 
ùêæ
K exceeds the height of the tree or the node doesn't have a 
ùêæ
K-th ancestor, return 
‚àí
1
‚àí1.
You can assume the binary tree does not contain duplicate values.

Node: 
5

ùêæ
=
2
K=2
Output:
1

Explanation:
Ancestors of 
5
5: 
2
‚Üí
1
2‚Üí1
ùêæ
=
2
K=2, so the 2nd ancestor of 
5
5 is 
1
1.
Approach
This can be solved using a DFS (Depth First Search) approach. As we traverse the tree, we check if the current node is the target node or contains the target node in one of its subtrees. While backtracking from the recursive calls, we decrement 
ùêæ
K and keep track of how far we‚Äôve moved up the tree.

Steps
Perform a recursive DFS traversal:

Check if the current node is the target node.
Recursively search for the target in the left and right subtrees.
During the backtracking phase:

Decrement 
ùêæ
K for each level up the tree.
When 
ùêæ
=
0
K=0, the current node is the 
ùêæ
K-th ancestor.
If 
ùêæ
>
0
K>0 after reaching the root, the 
ùêæ
K-th ancestor doesn‚Äôt exist.

    Node* findKthAncestor(Node* root, int& K, int target) {
        // Base case: if the tree is empty, return nullptr
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }

        // If the current node is the target, return the node

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: 
ùëÇ
(
ùëÅ
)
O(N), where 
ùëÅ
N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the DFS.
Space Complexity: 
ùëÇ
(
ùêª
)
O(H), where 
ùêª
H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack.

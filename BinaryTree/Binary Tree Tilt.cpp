Problem Explanation: Binary Tree Tilt
Description: The task is to calculate the tilt of a binary tree. The tilt for each node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of the values of the left subtree and the sum of the values of the right subtree. The tilt of the entire tree is the sum of the tilts of all nodes.

Example
Consider the following binary tree:

markdown
Copy code
         1
       /   \
      2     3
     / \
    4   5
Calculating the Tilt:
Node 4:

Left Sum = 0 (no children)
Right Sum = 0 (no children)
Tilt = |0 - 0| = 0
Node 5:

Left Sum = 0 (no children)
Right Sum = 0 (no children)
Tilt = |0 - 0| = 0
Node 2:

Left Sum (4) = 4
Right Sum (5) = 5
Tilt = |4 - 5| = 1
Node 3:

Left Sum = 0 (no children)
Right Sum = 0 (no children)
Tilt = |0 - 0| = 0
Root Node (1):

Left Sum (2) = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
Right Sum (3) = 3
Tilt = |11 - 3| = 8
Total Tilt of the Tree:
Total Tilt = 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 8 (Node 1) = 9.
Intuition Behind the Solution
The approach involves a post-order traversal of the binary tree:

Calculate the sum of the subtree for each node.
During the traversal, compute the tilt of each node by using the sums from the left and right subtrees.
Accumulate the total tilt in a variable.
Thought Process
Post-order Traversal: This traversal allows us to process the left child, then the right child, and finally the node itself, which is useful for calculating the sums of subtrees before computing the node's tilt.

Recursive Function: Create a recursive function that:

Returns the sum of values in the subtree rooted at the given node.
Updates the total tilt variable based on the tilt of the current node.
Base Case: When encountering a null node, return a sum of 0.

C++ Code Implementation
Here is the C++ code that implements the above logic:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int tilt = 0;  // Variable to keep track of the total tilt.

    // Helper function to calculate the sum of subtree and tilt.
    int calculateTilt(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;  // Base case: null node.

        // Calculate left and right subtree sums.
        int leftSum = calculateTilt(root->left);
        int rightSum = calculateTilt(root->right);

        // Calculate the tilt for the current node.
        tilt += abs(leftSum - rightSum);

        // Return the sum of values of the subtree rooted at the current node.
        return leftSum + rightSum + root->val;
    }

    // Function to calculate the tilt of the whole tree.
    int findTilt(TreeNode* root) {
        calculateTilt(root);  // Initiate the recursive calculation.
        return tilt;  // Return the total tilt.
    }
};
Dry Run Example
Let's dry run the code using the example tree defined above.

Construct the Binary Tree:
cpp
Copy code
TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
root->left = new TreeNode(2);
root->right = new TreeNode(3);
root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
Calculate the Tilt:
cpp
Copy code
Solution solution;
int totalTilt = solution.findTilt(root);
cout << "Total Tilt: " << totalTilt << endl;  // Expected output: 9
Execution of the Dry Run
Start at Node 1:

Move to Node 2.
At Node 2:

Move to Node 4.
At Node 4:

Left and Right both null, return 0 + 0 + 4 = 4.
Back to Node 2:

Left Sum = 4, move to Node 5.
At Node 5:

Left and Right both null, return 0 + 0 + 5 = 5.
Back to Node 2:

Left Sum = 4, Right Sum = 5.
Tilt = |4 - 5| = 1.
Return 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 to Node 1.
Back to Node 1:

Left Sum = 11, move to Node 3.
At Node 3:

Left and Right both null, return 0 + 0 + 3 = 3.
Back to Node 1:

Left Sum = 11, Right Sum = 3.
Tilt = |11 - 3| = 8.
Return 11 + 3 + 1 = 15 to the caller.
Final Output
The total tilt calculated is:

plaintext
Copy code
Total Tilt: 9
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This space is used for the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this can be O(N), and in the best case (a balanced tree), it will be O(log N).
This problem effectively illustrates the use of post-order traversal and recursion in calculating properties of binary trees.

Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, check if it is a perfect binary tree.

A perfect binary tree is defined as:

All non-leaf nodes have two children.
All leaf nodes are at the same level.
Intuition:
To check if a binary tree is perfect, we need to ensure that:

Every internal node (non-leaf node) has exactly two children.
All leaf nodes are at the same depth/level.
Approach:
We can solve this problem using the following steps:

Find the depth of the leftmost leaf node:

This gives the depth at which all leaf nodes should be.
We will traverse the tree from the root and keep track of the depth.
Check every node:

During the traversal, we will check:
If the node is a leaf, its depth must match the depth of the leftmost leaf node.
If the node is an internal node, it must have both left and right children.
If any of the conditions fail, the tree is not perfect.
Depth and size constraints:

A tree of depth d should have exactly 
2
𝑑
−
1
2 
d
 −1 nodes (a perfect binary tree’s node count).
We can use a helper function to calculate this.
Dry Run:
Let's dry-run the algorithm on an example:

Example 1:

Tree:

markdown
Copy code
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
Start by finding the depth of the leftmost leaf node:
Traverse down from root -> 1 -> 2 -> 4. Depth of 4 is 3.
Now, check each node:
Node 1 has two children (2 and 3) — valid.
Node 2 has two children (4 and 5) — valid.
Node 3 has two children (6 and 7) — valid.
All leaf nodes (4, 5, 6, 7) are at depth 3, which is correct.
The tree is a perfect binary tree.

Example 2:

Tree:

markdown
Copy code
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \     \
   4   5     6
Start by finding the depth of the leftmost leaf node:
Traverse down from root -> 1 -> 2 -> 4. Depth of 4 is 3.
Now, check each node:
Node 1 has two children (2 and 3) — valid.
Node 2 has two children (4 and 5) — valid.
Node 3 only has one child (6), which is invalid.
The tree is not a perfect binary tree.

Code in C++:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int getDepth(Node* root) {
    int depth = 0;
    while (root != NULL) {
        depth++;
        root = root->left;
    }
    return depth;
}

bool isPerfectUtil(Node* root, int depth, int level = 0) {
    // If the tree is empty
    if (root == NULL)
        return true;

    // If the node is a leaf node
    if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL) {
        return (level == depth - 1); // Check if leaf node is at the same level
    }

    // If the node has one child
    if (root->left == NULL || root->right == NULL) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    return isPerfectUtil(root->left, depth, level + 1) &&
           isPerfectUtil(root->right, depth, level + 1);
}

bool isPerfect(Node* root) {
    int depth = getDepth(root); // Get the depth of the leftmost leaf node
    return isPerfectUtil(root, depth);
}

int main() {
    // Example 1: Perfect Binary Tree
    Node* root1 = new Node(1);
    root1->left = new Node(2);
    root1->right = new Node(3);
    root1->left->left = new Node(4);
    root1->left->right = new Node(5);
    root1->right->left = new Node(6);
    root1->right->right = new Node(7);

    cout << (isPerfect(root1) ? "Perfect Binary Tree" : "Not a Perfect Binary Tree") << endl;

    // Example 2: Not a Perfect Binary Tree
    Node* root2 = new Node(1);
    root2->left = new Node(2);
    root2->right = new Node(3);
    root2->left->left = new Node(4);
    root2->left->right = new Node(5);
    root2->right->right = new Node(6);

    cout << (isPerfect(root2) ? "Perfect Binary Tree" : "Not a Perfect Binary Tree") << endl;

    return 0;
}
Dry Run with Code:
For root1, the tree is a perfect binary tree.

getDepth(root1) returns 3 (since the leftmost leaf node is at level 3).
isPerfectUtil(root1, 3) checks the nodes and confirms that all leaf nodes are at level 3 and all internal nodes have two children. Thus, the output will be "Perfect Binary Tree".
For root2, the tree is not perfect.

getDepth(root2) returns 3 (leftmost leaf node is at level 3).
isPerfectUtil(root2, 3) encounters node 3, which only has one child. Thus, the output will be "Not a Perfect Binary Tree".

Let's break down the intuition behind the code in a more digestible way:

Intuition Behind the Code:
We want to check if a binary tree is perfect. To do this, we need to verify two main things:

All internal nodes must have exactly two children (i.e., non-leaf nodes should always have a left and a right child).
All leaf nodes must be at the same depth (i.e., they must all be at the same level of the tree).
Steps and Explanation:
1. Find the Depth of the Leftmost Leaf Node:
We need to start by calculating the depth of the tree at the leftmost leaf node. The reason we focus on the leftmost leaf node is that in a perfect binary tree, all leaf nodes are at the same level, so checking the leftmost node is sufficient.

We start at the root of the tree and keep going down through the left child until we reach a leaf node.
The number of steps we take to reach this node is the depth of the tree.
Why is this important?

In a perfect binary tree, the depth of all leaf nodes should be the same. So by calculating the depth of the leftmost leaf node, we can ensure that all the leaf nodes must be at the same depth.
2. Check Every Node in the Tree:
Once we know the depth of the leftmost leaf node, we need to check the rest of the tree to ensure it satisfies two conditions:

Condition 1: If the node is a leaf, it should be at the same depth as the leftmost leaf.
If it's a leaf node and its depth is different from the leftmost leaf depth, we return false because the tree isn't perfect.
Condition 2: If the node is not a leaf (i.e., it's an internal node), it must have exactly two children.
If an internal node has only one child or no children, then the tree can't be perfect, so we return false.
3. Recursive Traversal:
To check these conditions efficiently, we use a recursive traversal:

We start from the root of the tree.
For each node, we check if it's a leaf or an internal node and verify its depth and children.
We recursively apply the same checks for both the left and right subtrees.
Dry Run of the Code:
Let's walk through an example step by step to understand how the code works:

Example 1:
Tree:

markdown
Copy code
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
Get the depth of the leftmost leaf:

Start from the root (node 1), move left to node 2, and then move left to node 4.
The depth of node 4 is 3 (level 3).
Store this depth as depth = 3.
Check the nodes:

Node 1 (root) has two children, so it's valid.
Node 2 has two children (4 and 5), so it's valid.
Node 3 has two children (6 and 7), so it's valid.
Node 4 is a leaf node at level 3, which matches the depth of the leftmost leaf. So it's valid.
Node 5 is a leaf node at level 3, which matches the depth. So it's valid.
Node 6 is a leaf node at level 3, which matches the depth. So it's valid.
Node 7 is a leaf node at level 3, which matches the depth. So it's valid.
Since all nodes follow the rules of a perfect binary tree, the tree is perfect.

Example 2:
Tree:

markdown
Copy code
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \     \
   4   5     6
Get the depth of the leftmost leaf:

Start from the root (node 1), move left to node 2, and then move left to node 4.
The depth of node 4 is 3 (level 3).
Store this depth as depth = 3.
Check the nodes:

Node 1 has two children (2 and 3), so it's valid.
Node 2 has two children (4 and 5), so it's valid.
Node 3 has only one child (6), which makes the tree invalid. It should have two children. Hence, return false.
Since node 3 doesn't have two children, the tree is not perfect.

Code Walkthrough:
Let's focus on the key parts of the code to understand the logic better:

getDepth Function:
This function computes the depth of the leftmost leaf node. It does this by traversing only the left child of each node. This guarantees that we get the depth of the leftmost leaf node.

cpp
Copy code
int getDepth(Node* root) {
    int depth = 0;
    while (root != NULL) {
        depth++;
        root = root->left;  // Keep going down the leftmost path
    }
    return depth;
}
isPerfectUtil Function:
This function checks whether a node satisfies the conditions of a perfect binary tree:

If the node is a leaf, we check if its depth matches the depth of the leftmost leaf node.
If the node is not a leaf, we ensure it has both a left and right child.
cpp
Copy code
bool isPerfectUtil(Node* root, int depth, int level = 0) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return true;

    // If the node is a leaf node
    if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL) {
        return (level == depth - 1); // Check if it's at the correct depth
    }

    // If the node is an internal node, it should have both left and right children
    if (root->left == NULL || root->right == NULL) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    return isPerfectUtil(root->left, depth, level + 1) &&
           isPerfectUtil(root->right, depth, level + 1);
}
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity:
The getDepth function runs in O(d) time, where d is the depth of the tree.
The isPerfectUtil function traverses every node in the tree, so the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(d) because of the recursion stack in isPerfectUtil, where d is the depth of the tree.
Conclusion:
This approach uses a depth-first search (DFS) traversal to check the conditions for a perfect binary tree, focusing on validating the depth of the leaf nodes and the number of children for internal nodes. The recursive approach ensures that the checks are performed efficiently while maintaining simplicity in the logic.

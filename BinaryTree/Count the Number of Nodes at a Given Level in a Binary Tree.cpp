Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree and a level L, the task is to count the number of nodes at the given level L in the binary tree. The level of a node is defined as the number of edges from the root to the node.

For example:

If the tree is like:

markdown
Copy code
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
And the level L is 2, the nodes at this level would be 4, 5, 6, and 7 (because their distance from the root is 2).

Intuition:
Level 0: This is the root node, so we just need to count the root node.
Level 1: These are the children of the root node.
Level 2: These are the grandchildren of the root, and so on.
To solve this problem, we can perform a level-order traversal (BFS) of the tree and count the nodes at the specific level L.

Approach:
Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Level-Order Traversal:
Perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree.
For each level, increment the count of nodes at that level.
If the current level is L, return the number of nodes at that level.
Queue Data Structure for BFS:
A queue can be used to implement BFS. Initially, we enqueue the root node.
Then, we dequeue nodes level by level and enqueue their children.
For each level, count the number of nodes and stop when we reach the desired level L.
Dry Run:
Consider the following binary tree:

markdown
Copy code
          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \   / \
     4   5 6   7
Let's say the level L is 2. We want to count how many nodes are at level 2.

Step 1: Start with the root node (1).

Enqueue the root node: queue = [1].
Step 2: Start BFS.

Process level 0: Dequeue 1 and enqueue its children (2 and 3).
Nodes at level 0: 1.
Step 3: Process level 1:

Dequeue 2 and enqueue its children (4 and 5).
Dequeue 3 and enqueue its children (6 and 7).
Nodes at level 1: 2, 3.
Step 4: Process level 2:

Dequeue 4, 5, 6, and 7 (no children to enqueue).
Nodes at level 2: 4, 5, 6, 7.
Result: There are 4 nodes at level 2.

Code in C++:
cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodesAtLevel(TreeNode* root, int L) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            return 0;  // If tree is empty, return 0.
        }

        // Queue to hold nodes during level order traversal.
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        int level = 0;
        int nodeCountAtLevel = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int nodeCountAtCurrentLevel = q.size();
            
            // If we are at level L, count nodes at this level.
            if (level == L) {
                return nodeCountAtCurrentLevel;
            }
            
            // Process all nodes at the current level.
            for (int i = 0; i < nodeCountAtCurrentLevel; i++) {
                TreeNode* currentNode = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                // Enqueue left and right children.
                if (currentNode->left != NULL) {
                    q.push(currentNode->left);
                }
                if (currentNode->right != NULL) {
                    q.push(currentNode->right);
                }
            }
            
            level++;  // Move to the next level.
        }

        // If the level is not found, return 0.
        return 0;
    }
};
Dry Run with Code:
Let's consider the same binary tree as in the example:

markdown
Copy code
          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \   / \
     4   5 6   7
And we want to count the nodes at level 2.

Initialization:

queue = [1]
level = 0, nodeCountAtLevel = 0
Level 0:

Process node 1.
Enqueue its left (2) and right (3) children.
queue = [2, 3]
After processing level 0: nodeCountAtCurrentLevel = 1 (node 1).
Increment level = 1.
Level 1:

Process nodes 2 and 3.
Enqueue their children (4, 5, 6, 7).
queue = [4, 5, 6, 7]
After processing level 1: nodeCountAtCurrentLevel = 2 (nodes 2, 3).
Increment level = 2.
Level 2:

Process nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 (leaf nodes).
No more children to enqueue.
After processing level 2: nodeCountAtCurrentLevel = 4 (nodes 4, 5, 6, 7).
Since we reached the desired level L = 2, return 4.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once during the BFS traversal.
Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the maximum number of nodes at any level. In the worst case (for a perfectly balanced tree), the space complexity would be O(N) when the leaf level is fully populated.
Conclusion:
This approach efficiently counts the number of nodes at any given level of a binary tree by performing a level-order traversal using BFS. It ensures that we only process nodes at the required level, making it both time and space efficient.

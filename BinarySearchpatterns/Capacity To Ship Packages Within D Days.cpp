The "Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days" problem can be solved efficiently using binary search. The idea is to find the minimum ship capacity such that you can ship all the packages within the given number of days.

Approach:
Binary Search on Capacity:

The ship's capacity can range from the weight of the heaviest package (the minimum possible capacity) to the sum of all package weights (the maximum possible capacity, where you ship everything in one day).
Use binary search to find the least capacity where all packages can be shipped within D days.
Feasibility Check:

For each candidate capacity, check whether it's possible to ship all the packages within D days.
Simulate the shipping process day by day. If the current package exceeds the remaining capacity of the current day, start a new day and reset the day's capacity.
Algorithm Steps:
Initialize Binary Search:

Set the left boundary low as the maximum weight of the packages (since the ship must be able to carry the heaviest package).
Set the right boundary high as the sum of all package weights (the ship capacity if we ship everything in one go).
Feasibility Function:

Write a helper function canShip(weights, D, capacity) that returns true if it's possible to ship all the packages within D days given the ship's capacity.
Binary Search Process:

Perform binary search between low and high. For each midpoint, use the canShip function to check whether that capacity can complete the shipping in D days.
If it can, reduce the capacity (move left); if not, increase the capacity (move right).
Code Implementation:
cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool canShip(vector<int>& weights, int D, int capacity) {
    int currentLoad = 0;
    int days = 1;  // Start with 1 day

    for (int weight : weights) {
        if (currentLoad + weight > capacity) {
            // Start a new day since current capacity exceeded
            days++;
            currentLoad = 0;
        }
        currentLoad += weight;

        // If we exceed the number of allowed days, return false
        if (days > D) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int D) {
    // The minimum capacity is the max weight (to carry the heaviest package)
    int low = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
    
    // The maximum capacity is the sum of all weights (carry everything in one day)
    int high = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);
    
    // Perform binary search
    while (low < high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;  // Midpoint capacity

        // If it's possible to ship within D days with this capacity
        if (canShip(weights, D, mid)) {
            high = mid;  // Try for a smaller capacity
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;  // Increase the capacity
        }
    }
    
    // The optimal capacity found via binary search
    return low;
}
Explanation:
canShip Function:

This function checks whether we can ship all the packages within D days using a given capacity. We iterate over the weights and accumulate them into currentLoad. If currentLoad exceeds the capacity, we start a new day, reset the load, and continue. If the number of days exceeds D, we return false.
Binary Search:

We perform binary search on the possible ship capacities. Initially, the search range is from the maximum weight (low) to the total sum of all weights (high). For each midpoint capacity, we check whether it's feasible to ship within D days. If it is feasible, we move towards smaller capacities, and if not, we increase the capacity.
Stopping Condition:

The binary search continues until low equals high, meaning we've found the minimum capacity that allows shipping within D days.
Time Complexity:
Binary Search: The search space is the difference between the maximum package weight and the total weight, which is O(log(sum(weights) - max(weights))).
Feasibility Check: For each capacity in the binary search, we iterate over the weights array to check if it can be shipped in D days. This takes O(n) where n is the number of packages.
Overall Time Complexity: The total complexity is O(n * log(sum(weights) - max(weights))).
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) (ignoring the input weights).
This solution efficiently finds the least capacity that satisfies the constraint of shipping all packages within D days using binary search and simulation.

Let's perform a dry run of the solution with a sample test case to understand how the binary search and the helper function (canShip) work together.

Test Case:
Input:
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
D = 5 (days to ship)
The goal is to find the least ship capacity such that the packages can be shipped in 5 days.

Step 1: Initialize Binary Search
low = max(weights) = 10 (The heaviest package must fit in the ship)
high = sum(weights) = 55 (Ship capacity if everything is shipped in one day)
The binary search will now try to minimize the ship capacity within this range.

Step 2: Perform Binary Search
Iteration 1:
Calculate mid = (low + high) / 2 = (10 + 55) / 2 = 32.
Call canShip(weights, D, 32) to check if we can ship all packages with a capacity of 32.
canShip(weights, D = 5, capacity = 32):

Day 1: Ship [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total load = 21, which is ≤ 32)
Day 2: Ship [7, 8] (Total load = 15, which is ≤ 32)
Day 3: Ship [9, 10] (Total load = 19, which is ≤ 32)
Result: It's possible to ship all packages within 3 days (which is ≤ 5 days).

Since it is possible to ship within 5 days with a capacity of 32, reduce the capacity:

high = mid = 32.
Iteration 2:
Calculate mid = (low + high) / 2 = (10 + 32) / 2 = 21.
Call canShip(weights, D, 21).
canShip(weights, D = 5, capacity = 21):

Day 1: Ship [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (Total load = 21, which is exactly 21)
Day 2: Ship [7, 8] (Total load = 15, which is ≤ 21)
Day 3: Ship [9, 10] (Total load = 19, which is ≤ 21)
Result: It's possible to ship all packages within 3 days (≤ 5 days).

Since it is possible to ship within 5 days with a capacity of 21, reduce the capacity:

high = mid = 21.
Iteration 3:
Calculate mid = (low + high) / 2 = (10 + 21) / 2 = 15.
Call canShip(weights, D, 15).
canShip(weights, D = 5, capacity = 15):

Day 1: Ship [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Total load = 15, which is exactly 15)
Day 2: Ship [6, 7] (Total load = 13, which is ≤ 15)
Day 3: Ship [8] (Total load = 8, which is ≤ 15)
Day 4: Ship [9, 10] (Total load = 19, exceeds 15, so move 10 to next day)
Day 5: Ship [10] (Total load = 10, which is ≤ 15)
Result: It's possible to ship all packages within 5 days (exactly 5 days).

Since it is possible to ship within 5 days with a capacity of 15, reduce the capacity:

high = mid = 15.
Iteration 4:
Calculate mid = (low + high) / 2 = (10 + 15) / 2 = 12.
Call canShip(weights, D, 12).
canShip(weights, D = 5, capacity = 12):

Day 1: Ship [1, 2, 3, 4] (Total load = 10, which is ≤ 12)
Day 2: Ship [5, 6] (Total load = 11, which is ≤ 12)
Day 3: Ship [7] (Total load = 7, which is ≤ 12)
Day 4: Ship [8] (Total load = 8, which is ≤ 12)
Day 5: Ship [9] (Total load = 9, which is ≤ 12)
Day 6: Ship [10] (Total load = 10, starts a new day, exceeding D = 5)
Result: It's not possible to ship within 5 days with a capacity of 12.

Since it's not possible, increase the capacity:

low = mid + 1 = 13.
Iteration 5:
Calculate mid = (low + high) / 2 = (13 + 15) / 2 = 14.
Call canShip(weights, D, 14).
canShip(weights, D = 5, capacity = 14):

Day 1: Ship [1, 2, 3, 4] (Total load = 10, which is ≤ 14)
Day 2: Ship [5, 6] (Total load = 11, which is ≤ 14)
Day 3: Ship [7] (Total load = 7, which is ≤ 14)
Day 4: Ship [8] (Total load = 8, which is ≤ 14)
Day 5: Ship [9, 10] (Total load = 19, exceeds 14, so move 10 to next day)
Day 6: Ship [10] (Exceeds D = 5)
Result: It's not possible to ship within 5 days with a capacity of 14.

Since it's not possible, increase the capacity:

low = mid + 1 = 15.
Conclusion:
At this point, low == high == 15, which means the minimum ship capacity needed to ship all packages within D = 5 days is 15.

Final Answer:
The least ship capacity to ship all packages within 5 days is 15.

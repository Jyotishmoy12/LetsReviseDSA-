Problem Explanation:
Find Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix:

You are given an n x n matrix where:
Each row is sorted in ascending order.
Each column is sorted in ascending order.
You need to find the kth smallest element in the matrix.
Approach:
To solve this problem, you can use a binary search on the range of values in the matrix or apply a min-heap. Since the binary search approach is more efficient for larger matrices, we'll focus on that method.

Concept:
Binary Search on Value Range:
The smallest element is at matrix[0][0], and the largest element is at matrix[n-1][n-1].
Perform binary search on this range, calculating the midpoint value.
Count how many elements in the matrix are less than or equal to this midpoint using a helper function.
If the count is less than k, move to the right half; otherwise, move to the left half.
Helper Function (Count Elements ≤ Mid):
Traverse each row and for each row, count how many elements are ≤ mid by utilizing the fact that rows are sorted.
This step runs in O(n) time.
Algorithm:
Set the search range between the smallest element matrix[0][0] and the largest element matrix[n-1][n-1].
For each midpoint mid, count the number of elements in the matrix less than or equal to mid.
If the count is greater than or equal to k, move the right boundary to mid. Otherwise, move the left boundary to mid + 1.
Continue until the search range narrows down to the kth smallest element.
C++ Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int countLessEqual(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int mid, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    int row = n - 1, col = 0;
    while (row >= 0 && col < n) {
        if (matrix[row][col] <= mid) {
            count += row + 1;
            col++;
        } else {
            row--;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    int left = matrix[0][0], right = matrix[n - 1][n - 1];

    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        int count = countLessEqual(matrix, mid, n);
        
        if (count < k) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return left;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
        {1, 5, 9},
        {10, 11, 13},
        {12, 13, 15}
    };
    int k = 8;
    cout << "The " << k << "th smallest element is " << kthSmallest(matrix, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Test Case:
Let's take the matrix:

csharp
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 5, 9],
    [10, 11, 13],
    [12, 13, 15]
]
and find the 8th smallest element (k = 8).

Dry Run:
Initial Setup:
left = matrix[0][0] = 1, right = matrix[2][2] = 15
k = 8
Iteration 1:
Calculate mid:
mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 1 + (15 - 1) / 2 = 8
Call countLessEqual(matrix, mid = 8, n = 3):
Start from the bottom-left of the matrix:
matrix[2][0] = 12 > 8, move up to matrix[1][0] = 10 > 8, move up to matrix[0][0] = 1 ≤ 8.
Add row + 1 = 1 to count, move to matrix[0][1] = 5 ≤ 8.
Add row + 1 = 1 to count, move to matrix[0][2] = 9 > 8.
Total count = 2.
Check count: Since count = 2 (which is less than k = 8), move left = mid + 1 = 9.
Iteration 2:
Calculate mid:
mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 9 + (15 - 9) / 2 = 12
Call countLessEqual(matrix, mid = 12, n = 3):
Start from the bottom-left of the matrix:
matrix[2][0] = 12 ≤ 12, add row + 1 = 3 to count, move to matrix[2][1] = 13 > 12.
Move up to matrix[1][1] = 11 ≤ 12, add row + 1 = 2 to count.
Total count = 6.
Check count: Since count = 6 (which is less than k = 8), move left = mid + 1 = 13.
Iteration 3:
Calculate mid:
mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 13 + (15 - 13) / 2 = 14
Call countLessEqual(matrix, mid = 14, n = 3):
Start from the bottom-left of the matrix:
matrix[2][0] = 12 ≤ 14, add row + 1 = 3 to count, move to matrix[2][1] = 13 ≤ 14, add row + 1 = 3 to count.
Move up to matrix[1][1] = 11 ≤ 14, add row + 1 = 2 to count.
Total count = 8.
Check count: Since count = 8 (which is equal to k = 8), move right = mid = 14.
Iteration 4:
Calculate mid:
mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 13 + (14 - 13) / 2 = 13
Call countLessEqual(matrix, mid = 13, n = 3):
Start from the bottom-left of the matrix:
matrix[2][0] = 12 ≤ 13, add row + 1 = 3 to count, move to matrix[2][1] = 13 ≤ 13, add row + 1 = 3 to count.
Move up to matrix[1][1] = 11 ≤ 13, add row + 1 = 2 to count.
Total count = 8.
Check count: Since count = 8 (which is equal to k = 8), move right = mid = 13.
Finally, left == right == 13, so the answer is 13.

Conclusion:
The 8th smallest element is 13.
Output: 13
Time Complexity:
Binary Search Complexity: O(log(max_val - min_val)) where max_val is the largest element in the matrix, and min_val is the smallest element.
Counting Elements ≤ Mid: O(n) for each row, so O(n) for all rows.
Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n log(max_val - min_val)).

Space Complexity:
Space complexity: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables and do not store additional data structures.

why it's right=mid instead of right=mid-1?

In the binary search algorithm for finding the Kth smallest element in a sorted matrix, the reason we set right = mid instead of right = mid - 1 is due to the following considerations:

Key Idea:
We are searching for the exact value of the Kth smallest element, not an index.
The matrix is sorted row-wise and column-wise, so we want to narrow down the value range where the Kth smallest element lies.
Why right = mid and not right = mid - 1?
Binary Search on Values:

In this problem, we are performing binary search not on the indices of the array but on the value range. This is important because our goal is to find the Kth smallest element, which is a specific value, not its position.
Count of Elements ≤ Mid:

At each iteration, we calculate how many elements in the matrix are less than or equal to mid. If the count is greater than or equal to k, it means that the Kth smallest element must lie in the current range between left and mid.

Setting right = mid ensures that we don't prematurely exclude the value mid from the range. There might still be a chance that mid itself is the Kth smallest element, so we keep it in the search space.

When to Narrow the Range:

If count < k, it means there are fewer than k elements smaller than or equal to mid, so we know that the Kth smallest element must be greater than mid. In this case, we move the left boundary to mid + 1 to exclude mid and search in the right half.

However, if count >= k, we need to continue searching in the left half, but we cannot exclude mid because it could be the exact element we are looking for. Therefore, we set right = mid to continue searching in the range that includes mid.

Why not right = mid - 1?
If we were to set right = mid - 1, we would risk excluding the exact value we are looking for, especially if mid happens to be the Kth smallest element.
The right = mid - 1 approach would be used if we were sure that mid is not the value we're looking for, but in this case, we don't know that. We want to keep mid in the range of potential candidates until we narrow the search down.
Example:
Consider the matrix:

csharp
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 5, 9],
    [10, 11, 13],
    [12, 13, 15]
]
Suppose we want to find the 8th smallest element (k = 8).

Initial search range: left = 1, right = 15

Midpoint: mid = 8

Count of elements ≤ 8 is 2. Since count < k, move left = mid + 1 = 9.
New search range: left = 9, right = 15

Midpoint: mid = 12

Count of elements ≤ 12 is 6. Since count < k, move left = mid + 1 = 13.
New search range: left = 13, right = 15

Midpoint: mid = 14

Count of elements ≤ 14 is 8. Since count == k, move right = mid = 14.
New search range: left = 13, right = 14

Midpoint: mid = 13

Count of elements ≤ 13 is 8. Since count == k, move right = mid = 13.
At this point, left == right == 13, so the Kth smallest element is 13.

If we had used right = mid - 1, we might have prematurely excluded the correct answer (13).

Conclusion:
Setting right = mid allows us to keep the search range intact and ensure we don't exclude the correct value prematurely.
It works well when searching for specific values in a range, especially when the condition (count >= k) indicates that the Kth smallest element might be within the current range.

Sure! Let's do a detailed dry run of the algorithm for finding the Kth smallest element in a sorted matrix using binary search. I will explain both the countLessEqual helper function and the main kthSmallest function.

Problem Recap:
We have an n x n matrix where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order. The task is to find the Kth smallest element in the matrix.

Algorithm Overview:
We are using binary search on the value range of elements in the matrix, i.e., the smallest element (matrix[0][0]) to the largest element (matrix[n-1][n-1]). At each step, we compute the mid-point of this range, and we count how many elements in the matrix are less than or equal to this mid-point. Based on this count, we adjust the search range.

Functions Used:
1. countLessEqual(matrix, mid):
This helper function counts how many elements in the matrix are less than or equal to mid.

Intuition: Since each row and column are sorted, we can efficiently count elements by traversing the matrix from the bottom-left corner (start of the last row).
If an element is less than or equal to mid, all elements in the current row to the left of it will also be less than or equal to mid.
Otherwise, move upwards to the previous row.
2. kthSmallest(matrix, k):
This is the main function that performs binary search on the value range of the matrix to find the Kth smallest element.

Dry Run Example:
Consider the matrix:

csharp
Copy code
matrix = [
    [1, 5, 9],
    [10, 11, 13],
    [12, 13, 15]
]
We are looking for the 8th smallest element (k = 8).

The matrix is 3x3, so n = 3.
Step-by-Step Dry Run:
Initialization:
left = matrix[0][0] = 1 (smallest element)
right = matrix[n-1][n-1] = 15 (largest element)
We'll now use binary search to narrow down this range.

First Iteration:
Mid Calculation:

mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 1 + (15 - 1) / 2 = 8.
Count Elements ≤ mid (Using countLessEqual):

Start from the bottom-left corner, row = 2, col = 0.

matrix[2][0] = 12 is greater than 8, so move up to row = 1.
matrix[1][0] = 10 is greater than 8, so move up to row = 0.
matrix[0][0] = 1 is less than or equal to 8, so count all elements in the current row up to col = 0. Move to col = 1.
matrix[0][1] = 5 is less than or equal to 8, so count it. Move to col = 2.
matrix[0][2] = 9 is greater than 8, stop the current row. Total count so far: 2.
Total count of elements ≤ 8 = 2.

Update left or right:

Since count < k, we move the left boundary: left = mid + 1 = 9.
Second Iteration:
Mid Calculation:

mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 9 + (15 - 9) / 2 = 12.
Count Elements ≤ mid:

Start from the bottom-left corner, row = 2, col = 0.

matrix[2][0] = 12 is less than or equal to 12, so count all elements in the current row up to col = 0. Move to col = 1.
matrix[2][1] = 13 is greater than 12, stop the current row. Move up to row = 1.
matrix[1][0] = 10 is less than or equal to 12, count it. Move to col = 1.
matrix[1][1] = 11 is less than or equal to 12, count it. Move to col = 2.
matrix[1][2] = 13 is greater than 12, stop the current row. Move up to row = 0.
matrix[0][2] = 9 is less than or equal to 12, count it.
Total count of elements ≤ 12 = 6.

Update left or right:

Since count < k, we move the left boundary: left = mid + 1 = 13.
Third Iteration:
Mid Calculation:

mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 13 + (15 - 13) / 2 = 14.
Count Elements ≤ mid:

Start from the bottom-left corner, row = 2, col = 0.

matrix[2][0] = 12 is less than or equal to 14, count it. Move to col = 1.
matrix[2][1] = 13 is less than or equal to 14, count it. Move to col = 2.
matrix[2][2] = 15 is greater than 14, stop the current row. Move up to row = 1.
matrix[1][0] = 10 is less than or equal to 14, count it. Move to col = 1.
matrix[1][1] = 11 is less than or equal to 14, count it. Move to col = 2.
matrix[1][2] = 13 is less than or equal to 14, count it.
Total count of elements ≤ 14 = 8.

Update left or right:

Since count == k, we move the right boundary: right = mid = 14.
Fourth Iteration:
Mid Calculation:

mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 13 + (14 - 13) / 2 = 13.
Count Elements ≤ mid:

Start from the bottom-left corner, row = 2, col = 0.

matrix[2][0] = 12 is less than or equal to 13, count it. Move to col = 1.
matrix[2][1] = 13 is less than or equal to 13, count it. Move to col = 2.
matrix[2][2] = 15 is greater than 13, stop the current row. Move up to row = 1.
matrix[1][0] = 10 is less than or equal to 13, count it. Move to col = 1.
matrix[1][1] = 11 is less than or equal to 13, count it. Move to col = 2.
matrix[1][2] = 13 is less than or equal to 13, count it.
Total count of elements ≤ 13 = 8.

Update left or right:

Since count == k, we move the right boundary: right = mid = 13.
Conclusion:
At the end of the loop, left == right == 13. So, the 8th smallest element in the matrix is 13.
Time Complexity Analysis:
The binary search on the value range runs in O(log(max-min)), where max and min are the maximum and minimum elements in the matrix.
The countLessEqual function runs in O(n) time, where n is the size of the matrix.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log(max-min)).
Space Complexity:
We only use a few extra variables, so the space complexity is O(1).

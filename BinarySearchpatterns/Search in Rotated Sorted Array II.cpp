Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (with Duplicates)
Given a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, find a target element. The array may be rotated at an unknown pivot, meaning that the array is divided into two parts, but these parts may not be uniquely identifiable due to the presence of duplicates.

Example 1:

text
Copy code
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Explanation: The target 0 is found in the array.
Example 2:

text
Copy code
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The target 3 is not in the array.
Intuition & Approach:
The problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but the key difference is that duplicates may exist, which complicates the process of determining whether the left or right half is sorted.

Key Observations:
Duplicates can break the condition where we rely on nums[left] and nums[mid] to identify the sorted half.
However, we can handle duplicates by skipping over equal elements. When nums[left] == nums[mid], increment left because duplicates provide no information about which side is sorted.
Steps:
Use two pointers, left and right, initialized to the start and end of the array.
Compute the middle index mid.
Compare nums[mid] with the target:
If nums[mid] == target, return true.
If nums[left] == nums[mid], increment left to skip the duplicate elements.
Otherwise, check whether the left or right half is sorted:
If the left half (nums[left] to nums[mid]) is sorted:
If the target is within the sorted range, move the search to the left half by adjusting right.
Otherwise, move to the right half by adjusting left.
If the right half (nums[mid] to nums[right]) is sorted:
If the target is within the sorted range, adjust left to search in the right half.
Otherwise, adjust right to search in the left half.
If no match is found, return false.
Code Implementation (C++):
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        // Check if target is found
        if (nums[mid] == target) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // If we encounter duplicates
        if (nums[left] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[right]) {
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        // If the left half is sorted
        else if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
            // Check if the target is within the sorted range
            if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        // If the right half is sorted
        else {
            // Check if the target is within the sorted range
            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2};
    vector<int> nums2 = {2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2};
    
    cout << "Is target 0 in nums1? " << (search(nums1, 0) ? "true" : "false") << endl; // Output: true
    cout << "Is target 3 in nums2? " << (search(nums2, 3) ? "true" : "false") << endl; // Output: false
    
    return 0;
}
Dry Run:
Test Case 1:
Input: nums = [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2], target = 0
Initial State: left = 0, right = 6
mid = (0 + 6) / 2 = 3 → nums[mid] = 0
Since nums[mid] == target, return true.
Output: true

Test Case 2:
Input: nums = [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2], target = 3

Initial State: left = 0, right = 6

mid = (0 + 6) / 2 = 3 → nums[mid] = 0
nums[mid] != target, check the left half. Since nums[left] <= nums[mid], the left half is sorted, but target is not in this range, so adjust left = mid + 1 = 4.
Second Iteration: left = 4, right = 6

mid = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5 → nums[mid] = 1
Since nums[mid] != target, check the left half again. The left half is sorted, but target is not in this range, so adjust left = mid + 1 = 6.
Third Iteration: left = 6, right = 6

mid = 6 → nums[mid] = 2
nums[mid] != target, and since there are no further elements to check, return false.
Output: false

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

In the worst case, if the array contains many duplicates, the algorithm will have to linearly scan through some elements, making the worst-case time complexity O(n). Without duplicates, the time complexity would be O(log n), as binary search reduces the search space by half.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only a few extra variables to manage indices.

Let's perform a detailed dry run of Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (with duplicates) using the C++ code implementation. I will include a test case that addresses all possible edge cases: duplicates, no rotation, full rotation, target at boundaries, and target missing from the array.

Test Case:
cpp
Copy code
Input: nums = [2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], target = 3
This case contains the following:

Duplicates (2 appears multiple times).
The array is rotated.
The target (3) is within the array.
Dry Run:
Initial Setup:
nums = [2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
target = 3
left = 0, right = 5
Iteration 1:
Calculate mid:
mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 0 + (5 - 0) / 2 = 2
nums[mid] = nums[2] = 2
Check if nums[mid] == target:
nums[mid] = 2, which is not equal to target = 3. So, we continue.
Check for duplicates:
nums[left] = nums[0] = 2
nums[mid] = nums[2] = 2
nums[right] = nums[5] = 2
Since nums[left] == nums[mid] == nums[right], we can't determine if the left or right half is sorted, so we increment left and decrement right to skip duplicates.
New values: left = 1, right = 4
Iteration 2:
Calculate mid:

mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 1 + (4 - 1) / 2 = 2
nums[mid] = nums[2] = 2
Check if nums[mid] == target:

nums[mid] = 2, which is not equal to target = 3. So, we continue.
Check if left half is sorted:

nums[left] = nums[1] = 2
nums[mid] = nums[2] = 2
Since nums[left] == nums[mid], the left half could still be sorted, but the target isn't in this part.
Check if right half is sorted:

nums[mid] = 2
nums[right] = nums[4] = 4
Since nums[mid] <= nums[right] and target = 3 lies between nums[mid] and nums[right], the target must be in the right half.
Update left = mid + 1 = 3.
Iteration 3:
Calculate mid:
mid = left + (right - left) / 2 = 3 + (4 - 3) / 2 = 3
nums[mid] = nums[3] = 3
Check if nums[mid] == target:
nums[mid] = 3, which is equal to the target.
Return true since the target is found.
Conclusion:
The target 3 is found in the array at index 3.
Output: true

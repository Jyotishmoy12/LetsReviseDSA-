Problem: Permutations of a String
Given a string, the task is to generate all possible permutations of the string. A permutation of a string is a rearrangement of its characters in all possible ways.

Approach:
To solve this problem, we'll use backtracking and recursion. The idea is to generate permutations by recursively swapping each character with itself and with all other characters that come after it in the string.

Key Intuition:
Recursive Permutations: Start with the first character and swap it with each of the remaining characters in the string. For each swap, recursively generate permutations of the remaining characters.
Backtracking: After generating permutations for a particular character swap, revert the swap to restore the original order of characters (backtracking) to try the next character.
Dry Run with Example:
Let's dry run the algorithm with the string "ABC".

Initial Call: permute("ABC", 0)

Swap Position 0 with 0: "ABC"
Recursive Call: permute("ABC", 1)
Swap Position 1 with 1: "ABC"
Recursive Call: permute("ABC", 2)
Swap Position 2 with 2: "ABC"
Reached End: Add "ABC" to results.
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "ABC".
Swap Position 1 with 2: "ACB"
Recursive Call: permute("ACB", 2)
Swap Position 2 with 2: "ACB"
Reached End: Add "ACB" to results.
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "ABC".
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "ABC".
Swap Position 0 with 1: "BAC"
Recursive Call: permute("BAC", 1)
Swap Position 1 with 1: "BAC"
Recursive Call: permute("BAC", 2)
Swap Position 2 with 2: "BAC"
Reached End: Add "BAC" to results.
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "BAC".
Swap Position 1 with 2: "BCA"
Recursive Call: permute("BCA", 2)
Swap Position 2 with 2: "BCA"
Reached End: Add "BCA" to results.
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "BAC".
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "ABC".
Swap Position 0 with 2: "CBA"
Recursive Call: permute("CBA", 1)
Swap Position 1 with 1: "CBA"
Recursive Call: permute("CBA", 2)
Swap Position 2 with 2: "CBA"
Reached End: Add "CBA" to results.
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "CBA".
Swap Position 1 with 2: "CAB"
Recursive Call: permute("CAB", 2)
Swap Position 2 with 2: "CAB"
Reached End: Add "CAB" to results.
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "CBA".
Backtrack: Swap back, restore "ABC".
Final Results: ["ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CBA", "CAB"]

Code in C++:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to generate permutations
    void permuteHelper(string& s, int start, vector<string>& result) {
        // Base case: if start index is at the end of the string
        if (start == s.size()) {
            result.push_back(s); // Add the permutation to results
            return;
        }

        // Recursive case: swap each character with the start position
        for (int i = start; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            swap(s[start], s[i]);          // Swap the characters
            permuteHelper(s, start + 1, result); // Recur for the next position
            swap(s[start], s[i]);          // Backtrack: swap back to original
        }
    }

    // Main function to generate all permutations
    vector<string> permute(string s) {
        vector<string> result;
        permuteHelper(s, 0, result);
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string input = "ABC"; // Example input
    vector<string> result = sol.permute(input);

    cout << "Permutations:\n";
    for (const string& perm : result) {
        cout << perm << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
Code Explanation:
Helper Function (permuteHelper):

Base Case: If the start index is equal to the size of the string, a permutation is complete, so add it to the result.
Recursive Case: For each position from start to the end of the string, swap the character at start with the current position i, recursively call permuteHelper with the next start index, then swap the characters back to restore the original string for the next iteration.
Main Function (permute):

Initializes the result vector and calls permuteHelper to start generating permutations.
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

Generating permutations involves n! permutations where n is the length of the string.
Each permutation requires O(n) operations to generate and store.
Overall time complexity is O(n * n!).
Space Complexity:

Space is required to store n! permutations.
Each permutation is O(n) in size.
Overall space complexity is O(n * n!) for storing permutations and O(n) for recursion stack.
Conclusion:
The backtracking approach effectively explores all possible character arrangements to generate permutations of the string. By swapping characters and using recursion, we can generate each permutation and handle backtracking to ensure all permutations are covered.

Sure! Let's dry run the provided code for the string "ABC" to understand how the permutations are generated. We'll break down each step of the recursion and swapping process.

Calls permuteHelper to start the permutation process with initial start index of 0.
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:

There are n! permutations for a string of length n.
Each permutation is generated in O(n) time.

Problem Explanation
Objective: Given a string, you need to find the k-th smallest lexicographical subsequence from the set of all its subsequences.

Concepts:

Subsequence: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Lexicographical Order: This is the dictionary order. For example, "apple" comes before "banana" in lexicographical order.
Intuition
To solve this problem, you need to:

Generate All Subsequences: Create all possible subsequences of the given string.
Sort Subsequences Lexicographically: Arrange all the generated subsequences in lexicographical order.
Select the k-th Smallest: Retrieve the k-th smallest subsequence from this sorted list.
This problem can be approached with recursive backtracking to generate subsequences and then sort them to find the k-th smallest.

Example
Consider the string "abc" and k = 2.

Generate Subsequences:

Possible subsequences: ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]
Sort Lexicographically:

Sorted list: ["a", "ab", "abc", "ac", "b", "bc", "c"]
Retrieve k-th Smallest:

For k = 2, the second smallest subsequence is "ab".
Dry Run
Let's dry run this with the string "abc" and k = 2.

Recursive Function Call:

Start with an empty current string and index 0.
Include or exclude each character recursively to generate subsequences.
Recursive Generation:

Call with index = 0: Choices are to include 'a' or not.
For inclusion of 'a':
Call with index = 1: Choices are to include 'b' or not.
For inclusion of 'b':
Call with index = 2: Choices are to include 'c' or not.
Include 'c': Subsequence "abc"
Exclude 'c': Subsequence "ab"
Exclude 'b':
Call with index = 2: Choices are to include 'c' or not.
Include 'c': Subsequence "ac"
Exclude 'c': Subsequence "a"
Exclude 'a':
Call with index = 1: Choices are to include 'b' or not.
For inclusion of 'b':
Call with index = 2: Choices are to include 'c' or not.
Include 'c': Subsequence "bc"
Exclude 'c': Subsequence "b"
Exclude 'b':
Call with index = 2: Choices are to include 'c' or not.
Include 'c': Subsequence "c"
Exclude 'c': Subsequence ""
Sorting:

All subsequences are sorted: ["", "a", "ab", "abc", "ac", "b", "bc", "c"]
Retrieve k-th Smallest:

For k = 2, the second smallest is "ab".
Code in C++
Here’s a C++ implementation using recursion and backtracking:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Function to generate all subsequences
void generateSubsequences(string s, int index, string current, vector<string>& subsequences) {
    if (index == s.length()) {
        if (!current.empty()) {
            subsequences.push_back(current);
        }
        return;
    }
    // Exclude the current character
    generateSubsequences(s, index + 1, current, subsequences);
    // Include the current character
    generateSubsequences(s, index + 1, current + s[index], subsequences);
}

// Function to find the k-th smallest lexicographical subsequence
string kthSmallestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
    vector<string> subsequences;
    generateSubsequences(s, 0, "", subsequences);
    sort(subsequences.begin(), subsequences.end());
    if (k > 0 && k <= subsequences.size()) {
        return subsequences[k - 1];
    }
    return ""; // k is out of bounds
}

int main() {
    string s = "abc";
    int k = 2;
    string result = kthSmallestSubsequence(s, k);
    cout << "The " << k << "-th smallest lexicographical subsequence is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:

Generating Subsequences: Each character can either be included or excluded, leading to 2^n subsequences for a string of length n. Therefore, generating all subsequences has a time complexity of 
𝑂
(

𝑛
)
O(2 
n
 ).
Sorting Subsequences: Sorting 2^n subsequences has a time complexity of

 log(2

 ))=O(n⋅2 
n
 ) since each subsequence can be up to n characters long.
Space Complexity:

Storing Subsequences: We store up to 2^n subsequences, and each subsequence can be up to n characters long. Therefore, the space complexity is 
𝑂
(

O(n⋅2n), primarily due to the storage of all subsequences and sorting.
This approach, while straightforward, may not be efficient for very large strings due to exponential growth in the number of subsequences.

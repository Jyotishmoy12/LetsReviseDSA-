Problem: Combination Sum II
Problem Statement:

Given an array of candidates and a target number, find all unique combinations where the candidate numbers sum up to the target. Each number in the array may be used more than once, but each combination must be unique.

Example:

Candidates: [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 5, 1]
Target: 8
Approach:
Sort Candidates: This helps in efficiently skipping duplicates.
Backtracking: Recursively explore all combinations, ensuring uniqueness by skipping duplicates.
Base Case: When the target becomes zero, add the current combination to the results.
Dry Run:
Initial Array: [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 5, 1]

Sorted Array: [1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10]

Final Combinations Found:

[1, 2, 5]
Summary:

Sort the candidates to handle duplicates effectively.
Use backtracking to explore all possible combinations.
Avoid duplicates by skipping repeated elements in the same recursion level.
This approach ensures that all unique combinations are found while efficiently avoiding duplicates through sorted input and careful recursive exploration.

Here’s the C++ code for solving the Combination Sum II problem, along with an analysis of its time and space complexity:

C++ Code
cpp
Copy code
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void backtrack(vector<int>& candidates, int target, int start, vector<int>& path, vector<vector<int>>& results) {
        if (target == 0) {
            results.push_back(path);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = start; i < candidates.size(); ++i) {
            // Skip duplicate elements
            if (i > start && candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]) continue;
            // If the current candidate exceeds the target, no need to continue
            if (candidates[i] > target) break;

            // Include the current element and move forward
            path.push_back(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(candidates, target - candidates[i], i + 1, path, results);
            path.pop_back(); // Backtrack to explore other possibilities
        }
    }

    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum2(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        vector<int> path;

        // Sort the array to handle duplicates and facilitate early stopping
        sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end());

        // Start backtracking from the first index
        backtrack(candidates, target, 0, path, results);

        return results;
    }
};
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:

Sorting: The sort function has a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the candidates array.
Backtracking: The backtracking function explores all possible combinations. In the worst case, the number of possible combinations is exponential. Specifically, if every element is distinct and we include each element in a subset, the complexity could be approximated as 
𝑂
(
2
𝑛
)
O(2 
n
 ), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the array. However, since we also handle duplicates and pruning in this problem, the practical complexity might be significantly less but still exponential in nature.
Space Complexity:

Recursion Stack: The recursion stack space is proportional to the depth of the recursion tree. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion tree could be 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) where 
𝑛
n is the length of the array.
Path Storage: The space required for storing paths in the results vector can be significant. In the worst case, all possible combinations are stored. Since the number of combinations can be exponential, the space complexity could be 
𝑂
(
2
𝑛
)
O(2 
n
 ) in the worst case.
Sorting: The space complexity for sorting is 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn) due to the sorting algorithm's space requirements.

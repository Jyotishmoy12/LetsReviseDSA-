The binary search part of the "Split Array Largest Sum" problem is used to efficiently find the minimum possible largest sum of the subarrays. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the binary search works and why it's essential for solving this problem.

Problem Recap
The goal is to split the array nums into m subarrays such that the largest sum among the subarrays is minimized. We need to find the smallest value of this largest sum using binary search.

Key Idea
We don't know what the minimum possible largest sum is, but we can reason about its range:

Lower bound (left): The smallest possible value for the largest subarray sum is the maximum element in nums. This is because, in the worst case, if we had only one element in each subarray, the largest sum would be the maximum element of nums.

left
=
max
⁡
(
nums
)
left=max(nums)
Upper bound (right): The largest possible value for the largest subarray sum is the sum of all elements in nums. This would happen if we didn't split the array at all (i.e., all elements are in one subarray).

right
=
∑
(
nums
)
right=∑(nums)
Binary Search Process
The binary search is performed between these two bounds, left (max element) and right (sum of elements), to efficiently find the smallest value of the largest sum.

Steps
Initialize the search space:

left = max(nums)
right = sum(nums)
Binary search:

While left < right:
Compute the middle of the current range: mid = (left + right) / 2.
Use the helper function canSplit(nums, m, mid) to check if it's possible to split the array into m subarrays such that the largest subarray sum is at most mid.
If it's possible to split the array within mid, then the current mid is a valid candidate for the minimum largest sum, but there might be a smaller valid value, so we move the search space left by setting right = mid.
If it's not possible to split the array within mid, then mid is too small, and we need to increase the largest sum, so we move the search space right by setting left = mid + 1.
End condition:

When left equals right, the binary search terminates, and left will contain the smallest possible value of the largest sum that satisfies the condition of splitting the array into m subarrays.
Code for Binary Search
cpp
Copy code
int splitArray(vector<int>& nums, int m) {
    int left = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // The maximum single element
    int right = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0); // The sum of all elements
    
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Calculate the middle point
        
        // Check if we can split the array into m subarrays with max sum <= mid
        if (canSplit(nums, m, mid)) {
            right = mid; // If possible, try a smaller max sum
        } else {
            left = mid + 1; // Otherwise, increase the max sum
        }
    }
    
    return left; // This will be the minimum largest sum
}
Key Points to Understand the Binary Search
Initial Search Space:

Left boundary (left): This represents the smallest possible largest sum, i.e., the maximum element in the array. Any valid split must have at least one subarray containing this element, so no subarray's sum can be smaller than this.
Right boundary (right): This represents the largest possible sum, i.e., the sum of all elements. This occurs when the entire array is treated as one subarray.
Middle Point (mid):

This is the midpoint between left and right. The goal is to test whether it's possible to split the array such that the largest sum of the subarrays does not exceed mid.
Shrinking the Search Space:

If canSplit(nums, m, mid) returns true, it means it's possible to split the array into m subarrays with a maximum subarray sum ≤ mid. In this case, we try to find an even smaller largest sum by moving right = mid.
If canSplit(nums, m, mid) returns false, it means we need a larger largest sum to successfully split the array into m subarrays. So, we move the search space to the right by setting left = mid + 1.
Termination:

When left == right, we've narrowed down the search space to a single value, which represents the smallest possible largest sum that allows us to split the array into m subarrays.
Example
Let’s walk through an example with nums = [7, 2, 5, 10, 8] and m = 2:

Initial bounds:

left = max(nums) = 10 (the largest element in nums)
right = sum(nums) = 32 (the sum of all elements)
First iteration:

mid = (10 + 32) / 2 = 21
We call canSplit(nums, m, 21):
Split the array as [7, 2, 5] and [10, 8]. Both subarrays have sums ≤ 21, so it’s possible to split with maxSum = 21.
Therefore, we set right = mid = 21.
Second iteration:

mid = (10 + 21) / 2 = 15
We call canSplit(nums, m, 15):
Try to split the array: [7, 2, 5] has a sum of 14, but adding 10 exceeds 15, so we split at [7, 2, 5] and [10, 8].
This is also valid, so we set right = mid = 15.
Third iteration:

mid = (10 + 15) / 2 = 12
We call canSplit(nums, m, 12):
Split the array: [7, 2] and [5, 10] exceed 12, so this is not valid. We set left = mid + 1 = 13.
Fourth iteration:

mid = (13 + 15) / 2 = 14
We call canSplit(nums, m, 14):
We split at [7, 2, 5] and [10, 8]. This is valid, so we set right = mid = 14.
Fifth iteration:

mid = (13 + 14) / 2 = 13
We call canSplit(nums, m, 13):
Splitting at [7, 2] and [5, 10] is not valid, so we set left = mid + 1 = 14.
End of search:

Now left == right == 14. This is the minimum largest sum we can achieve while splitting the array into 2 subarrays.
Time Complexity of the Binary Search
Binary Search Complexity: The binary search runs in O(log(S)) where S is the range of possible sums, i.e., sum(nums) - max(nums). This is because we are halving the search space each time.

canSplit Complexity: The canSplit function runs in O(n) time, where n is the size of nums, as it processes each element exactly once.

Total Complexity: The total time complexity is O(n * log(S)), where S = sum(nums) - max(nums).

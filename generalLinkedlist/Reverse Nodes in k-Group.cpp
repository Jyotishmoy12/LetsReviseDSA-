 we can solve Reverse a Linked List in Groups of K using recursion or a stack to make it more intuitive. Both approaches follow a divide-and-conquer or step-by-step approach, making it easier to manage groups of k nodes at a time.

1. Recursive Approach
In this approach, we recursively reverse each group of k nodes and then connect the reversed sublist with the result of the next recursive call.

Recursive Intuition
Base case: If the number of nodes left in the list is less than k, we return the head because no further reversal is needed.
Recursively reverse the next group of k nodes.
Reverse the current group of k nodes, and then attach it to the result of the next recursive call.
Recursive Code in C++
cpp
Copy code
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};

ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
    ListNode* curr = head;
    int count = 0;
    
    // Step 1: Count k nodes
    while (curr != nullptr && count < k) {
        curr = curr->next;
        count++;
    }
    
    // Step 2: If we found k nodes, reverse this group
    if (count == k) {
        curr = reverseKGroup(curr, k);  // Recursively reverse next group
        
        // Step 3: Reverse current group
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* temp = nullptr;
        while (count-- > 0) {
            temp = head->next;
            head->next = curr;
            curr = head;
            head = temp;
        }
        
        head = curr;  // New head after reversal
    }
    
    // Return new head (after reversing current group of k)
    return head;
}
Dry Run (Recursive Approach)
Input
rust
Copy code
Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
K = 3
Steps:
First Call: Reverse the first 3 nodes (1 -> 2 -> 3):

Reverse these 3 nodes.
Make a recursive call for the next part of the list (4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9).
After the first recursive call, the list looks like:
rust
Copy code
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9]
Second Call: Reverse the next 3 nodes (4 -> 5 -> 6):

Reverse these 3 nodes.
Make a recursive call for the next part of the list (7 -> 8 -> 9).
After the second recursive call, the list looks like:
rust
Copy code
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> [7 -> 8 -> 9]
Third Call: Reverse the next 3 nodes (7 -> 8 -> 9):

Reverse these 3 nodes.
No more nodes left, so the recursion ends.
Final list:
rust
Copy code
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7
Time and Space Complexity (Recursive Approach)
Time Complexity: Each node is processed exactly once, so the time complexity is O(n).
Space Complexity: The recursion depth is at most n/k (number of groups), so the space complexity is O(n/k) due to the recursive stack.
2. Stack-Based Approach
Using a stack to reverse groups of k nodes is more intuitive because we can push nodes onto the stack and pop them to reverse the order.

Stack Intuition
Traverse the list and push nodes onto a stack until we have k nodes.
Pop the nodes from the stack and reconnect them in reversed order.
Continue this process until the end of the list.
Stack-Based Code in C++
cpp
Copy code
#include <stack>

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};

ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
    if (head == nullptr || k == 1) return head;  // Edge cases
    
    std::stack<ListNode*> nodeStack;
    ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);  // Dummy node
    ListNode* prev = dummy;
    ListNode* curr = head;
    
    while (curr != nullptr) {
        ListNode* temp = curr;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Step 1: Push k nodes onto the stack
        while (curr != nullptr && count < k) {
            nodeStack.push(curr);
            curr = curr->next;
            count++;
        }
        
        // Step 2: If we have k nodes, pop and reverse them
        if (count == k) {
            while (!nodeStack.empty()) {
                prev->next = nodeStack.top();
                nodeStack.pop();
                prev = prev->next;
            }
            prev->next = curr;  // Reconnect to the remaining list
        }
    }
    
    return dummy->next;
}
Dry Run (Stack-Based Approach)
Input
rust
Copy code
Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
K = 3
Steps:
First Group:

Push 1, 2, 3 onto the stack.
Pop and reconnect as 3 -> 2 -> 1.
After processing the first group:
rust
Copy code
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> [4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9]
Second Group:

Push 4, 5, 6 onto the stack.
Pop and reconnect as 6 -> 5 -> 4.
After processing the second group:
rust
Copy code
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> [7 -> 8 -> 9]
Third Group:

Push 7, 8, 9 onto the stack.
Pop and reconnect as 9 -> 8 -> 7.
After processing the third group:
rust
Copy code
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7
Time and Space Complexity (Stack-Based Approach)
Time Complexity: Each node is pushed onto the stack once and popped once, so the time complexity is O(n).
Space Complexity: The stack holds up to k nodes at a time, so the space complexity is O(k).
Conclusion
Recursive Approach: Intuitive for those comfortable with recursion. Works well, but recursion depth might be a concern for very large inputs.
Stack-Based Approach: Intuitive and avoids recursion. Slightly more space due to the stack, but generally easier to understand.
